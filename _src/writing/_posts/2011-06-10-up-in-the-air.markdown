Ten years ago, Steve Jobs announced a strategy for the role their computers would take going forward, as the "digital hub of your digital lifestyle". This strategy played out into the development of iTunes as we know it today, an increasingly misnamed central location for music, videos, podcasts, even documents and apps, that manages the synchronization of your content between your devices.

This week Jobs announced another new direction for Apple, moving that central location from your computer to a data center owned and operated by Apple with the introduction of a new service called iCloud.

Apple is joining a trend toward moving data onto servers outside the home which has been growing over the past decade with services like Microsoft Exchange, Google Apps such as Gmail and Calendar, Facebook's store of personal info and photos and social exchanges, Twitter's store of missives, Flickr's store of photos, Delicious and Pinboard's store of links, Blogger and Wordpress.com and Tumblr's store of blog posts, YouTube's store of videos, Dropbox's store of files and folders, and on and on.

The proposed value of all these services keeping data on internet-accessible servers is two-fold.[^1] One feature is the convenience of ubiquitous portable access. Gmail users can check their email as easily from a web browser at the public library as from their computer's email application at home. The other feature is the ability to share information among multiple people with greater ease. With Dropbox, I can share a file with my coworkers simply by placing it in a folder that is shared between us. Rather than worrying about any sort of connection between my computer and theirs, Dropbox offers a central location that we each can pull from and push to, so we each have only to worry about our connection to Dropbox's central service.

[^1]: There is a third aspect which one could also argue is a feature, but which complicates the picture enough that adding it in here would simply make too much of a mess of things. That is the promise of increased value from the aggregate of large amounts of data. Notably, this third feature only plays a role in 8 of the 13 services listed above. And in the case of 4 the main value created by the aggregate is targeted advertising, or more generously, free service.

In both cases there is a strong, possibly unavoidable, tendency to become locked into the services in question. It does not need to be said that there is a compelling incentive for these companies to lock you and your data into their services. Any efforts to the contrary expose their services to potential competitors.

There are also privacy concerns with this approach.
