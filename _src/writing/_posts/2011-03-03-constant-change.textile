The day after the 2006 mid-term elections, President Bush announced that "Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld would resign his post":http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/09/us/politics/09elect.html, and that Robert Gates was his choice for the new secretary. Gates had served previously as the director of the CIA. He had been at Texas A&M University since 1999, and at the time of Rumsfeld's departure, Gates was president of the university.

The November 2006 issue of <cite>Texas Monthly</cite> featured Gates "on the cover":http://www.texasmonthly.com/2006-11-01/index.php with the headline "Can This Guy Save the Aggies?: Robert Gates to the rescue". Paul Burka wrote "the feature story":http://www.texasmonthly.com/2006-11-01/feature.php, "Agent of Change", describing Gates' challenge in trying to promote needed changes at a campus like A&M:

bq. All of this transformation is occurring at a university that, deep down, has never wanted to be transformed and has always viewed change with a narrow range of emotions bracketed by suspicion and hostility. This article is my sixth story about Texas A&M in nine and a half years, and while the nominal subjects have been different, all stories about A&M have the same underlying theme: the need for the university to evolve, as seen by its leaders, and the continuing antipathy to change, as voiced by its present and former students. That the resistance is based upon affection—the unimaginable degree to which Aggies mate with their school for life and ask nothing more of it than that it remain the same as when they were students—does not make it less difficult to overcome. If anything, the opposite is true. Every Aggie is a self-appointed guardian of the Aggie spirit, eternally on the alert for signs of slippage.
