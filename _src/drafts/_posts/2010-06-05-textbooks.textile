title: Textbooks

Textbooks are meant to be a learning aid, but all too often they are anything but. Why? For one thing, students hate them. Most textbooks are long, tediously written, and disengaging. The current approach to improving this situation - adding graphics and photography; providing extra pieces of navigation like highlights, keywords, quizzes, overviews, reviews - is not working. You don't have to read a study to know this, go ask a student. The current state of textbooks reflects a marketer's view of the world: Maybe students will want to learn if we dress up knowledge in a prettier package and present it in a way that makes it easier to approach.

I say bullshit. Students want to learn because they are interested in something. If they aren't interested in something, shitty graphics and keyword callouts are not the answer. The answer is either make it interesting or get out of the student's way so that she can discover what is interesting herself.
