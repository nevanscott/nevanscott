Literature is strewn with dynamic-duo bonhomie going back to Gilgamesh and Enkidu. Who could forget the scene where the two warriors meet?

bq. They met in the plaza of the district.
Enkidu blocked the gate with his foot,
Not permitting Gilgamesh to enter.
They seized (each other), like oxen, they fought.
The threshold they demolished; the wall they impaired.
Gilgamesh and Enkidu seized (each other).
Like oxen they fought.
The threshold they demolished; the wall they impaired.
Gilgamesh bent his foot to the ground,
His wrath was appeased, his breast was quieted.
When his breast was quieted,
Enkidu to him spoke, to Gilgamesh:
"As a unique one, thy mother bore thee..."[1]

One still fresh from the wild, the other entrenched in his role in civilized life, their first communication is without language: a fight.
