I live and work in New York, and have close friends and family in San Francisco, Seattle, and Austin. I enjoy collaborating closely with people I respect, and having great conversations with friends  I love.

I sometimes take ideas a little too seriously, but people who get to know me seem to get used to it.

This site holds some of my writing and projects I've been working on. There's "a feed for my writing":/index.xml, if you like.
