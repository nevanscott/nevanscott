A nostalgic monster-movie from J.J. Abrams. The story centers on a group of kids in a steel town in Ohio who are making a monster movie of their own. Abrams captures 1979 quite beautifully (my best guess having never seen it in person), and the team of kids are a lot of fun to follow around. The monster stuff is fairly standard, but monster movies aren't really my thing. Elle Fanning is especially fun to watch. In true Sarah Lawrence fashion, Abrams tows the line between mainstream storytelling and developing characters who might otherwise belong in an indie movie.
