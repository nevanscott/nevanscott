A couple of weeks ago, I received this email from a friend:

> Nevan,

> [Redacted]

Now, it's hard to say no to something like that, and I decided it was a great opportunity to go see a movie I had no pre-impressions of. (This method had worked great several years ago when some high school friends dragged me to <cite>American Splendor</cite>.) So I put it in my mind that I'd go see it soon.

A couple of days later, I happened to walk by the poster for <cite>Beginners</cite>, somewhat ruining my plan to go in knowing nothing. All I took in were the actors. *Oh!*, I thought, trying not to look too closely at the poster for the movie I was trying to remain ignorant about. *Ewan McGregor, Christopher Plummer, and that actress from <cite>Cashback</cite>. Certainly sounds like a Britishy good time.*

As luck would have it, I was already planning on seeing <cite>The Tree of Life</cite> that afternoon with another friend.[^beginners2] I called ahead to see if she'd rather meet for <cite>Beginners</cite> instead. That's how I wound up at this movie.

I should point out that "that actress from <cite>Cashback</cite>" is [Emilia Fox](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0288976/), who also happens to not be in this movie. In fact, I had mistaken MÃ©lanie Laurent (of <cite>Inglourious Basterds</cite> fame) for her. Just so we're on the same page, I sat down to the movie expecting a British indie film.

The movie starts out without speaking, with a quiet montage of Oliver (McGregor) cleaning out his father's (Plummer) house after he has passed away. Then he starts speaking, and I realize that he's trying to do an American accent. *OK*, I think, *this must be about Americans*. Indeed it is. Even Plummer is playing an American as best he can. (For some reason, old man voice seems to hold up a great deal in the transition across the Atlantic, but still has a bit of uncanniness, *cf.* Ian McKellen in <cite>The Shadow</cite>.[^beginners3])

[^beginners1]: She has spoken roughly like this since she became an Anglophile. (She's specifically enamored with Ireland, but I can't find a word for that, so it's a parenthetical in a footnote instead.)

[^beginners2]: Next time I'll make up names, I promise.

[^beginners3]: Or don't. It's really not a good movie. Tim Curry's American accent is also pretty uncanny in <cite>The Shadow</cite>, and downright bizarre in his performance as Dale the Whale in the Season 2 finale of <cite>Monk</cite>, "Mr. Monk Goes to Jail".
