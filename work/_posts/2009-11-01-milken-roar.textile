short: I designed a new high school newspaper website.
description: At "Reason Media Group":http://www.reasonmediagroup.com/, we started dialogue with the "Milken Community High School":http://www.milkenschool.org/ in Los Angeles about building and designing a site for the school's student-run newspaper. I got to take the design lead for this early prototype, which showcases some of our thinking about what a modern high school online publication might be like.

    description: <p>My overall approach was to create a design that would feel fresh even though the site would only be updated with new featured articles about every two weeks, to take the pressure off of publishing all the time. We made room in the design for easily updated areas, one which we called "In Brief", and another for sports scores.</p><p>Visually, I tried to retain a sense of authority that a newspaper might have while adding some of the visual expressiveness of a magazine. To this end, I chose to employ The League of Movable Type's "League Gothic":http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/7-league-gothic for display throughout the design, using text-replacement handled by "Cuf&oacute;n":http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon.</p>

    description: I wanted to give the editorial staff an easy way to manage images, so I started off with a simple default full-width image with a caption. I was lucky enough to have some PDFs of the actual paper to play with actual stories and photographs that students had published in the past while designing.

    description: After working with our designer "Cori&nbsp;Johnson":http://madebycori.com/ to refine the logo they had been using, I decided to build a bit of flexibility into the design by having it accomodate changes in color. These are just a few of my own poor color choices. For demonstration purposes, I tossed in Stefan Petre's "ColorPicker plugin":http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/ for jQuery, with the idea that a final version of the site would have a way for the editors to set the color scheme themselves on a regular basis.

    description: As part of the proposed changes, we were encouraging the newpaper students to work with the video journalism students to bring the video productions to The Roar's website.
