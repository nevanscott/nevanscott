description: Ridelust is a blog dedicated to cars with a very masculine voice - a strong contender for the most unlikely project I've ever been asked to work on. (My Sarah Lawrence education didn't really come up.) I helped with some of the design work, fleshing out details based on <a href="http://www.tyfujimura.com/">Ty Fujimura</a>'s initial designs and direction. This was a redesign of their Wordpress-based site, so some care had to be taken in the transition to the new design. I built out most of the design and Wordpress integration with help from the talented <a href="http://afoxberger.net/">Alex Berger</a>.

    description: Ty designed this great way to feature articles on the homepage, which presented some fun challenges for Alex and me as we built it. I'm really pleased with how it turned out.

    description: <p>The biggest design challenge was supporting all the ads without making it too difficult for readers to focus on what they came for - "hoonage":http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hoonage.</p><p>(The biggest development challenge was accomodating all the slanted boxes.)</p>
