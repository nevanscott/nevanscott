description: I joined "Reason Media Group":http://www.reasonmediagroup.com/ as they took on building POM's new website with the goal of engaging POM's community of fans alongside POM's design agency, "Fire Station":http://www.roll.com/fire-station-agency.php. When I joined, the project was already slated to be built on "Wordpress":http://wordpress.org/ and "Buddypress":http://buddypress.org/; I worked with another developer to build out the new site over three months, taking care of both front-end and back-end development tasks. After the site's launch, RMG(Reason Media Group) was asked to further the design, so I took on a more leading role in front-end development and design.

    description: <p>POM's homepage needed to emphasize all of the activity going on in the community without being overwhelming. I advocated using a more structured design, so that we could accomodate a dense amount of information without looking too busy.</p><p>A prior version of the site had three different areas that were cross-fading - the feature area, tweets, and testimonials. I wanted to cut down on the calamity, so I built a jQuery plugin that allowed the activity bubbles from the new community activity feed to scroll in from the top.</p>

    description: When it came time to build a new landing page for the community section of the site, my choice to use a grid for layout paid off because we were able to easily reuse design elements that we had built for the homepage.

    description: As part of POM's strategy for engaging with their customers, they began holding regular contests, and we needed an easy way for members of the POM team to add new contests to the site that would in turn be easy for members of the site to participate in.

    description: Early on in the first round of the project, I took some time to build this custom rotation image area using jQuery, to showcase the photography of their recipes. Not much to look at, but this was a big step up from relying on Flash, and I had only been working with jQuery for a few weeks at the time.
