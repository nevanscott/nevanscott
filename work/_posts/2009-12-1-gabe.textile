description: Gabe is a close friend and frequent collaborator, and I have helped him with his web presence for a couple of years now. For this most recent round, I asked him to let me take on the bulk of the design work for his portfolio, so that he could focus on what he was working on at the time. After my initial draft, he worked on a great background and we hammered out details until we arrived at a good starting place to grow the site from. Really, you should stop reading this and "go see his stuff":http://gabrielaronson.com/.

    description: There really isn't anything innovative here. Mostly, I wanted something that would be dead-simple to navigate and easy for Gabe to update, that would visually stay out of the way so that all of his work could really shine, but have a quirky feel to complement Gabe's sensibilities.

    description: I think this may be the only time I have successfully grabbed a photo from Facebook and had it work with a design.
