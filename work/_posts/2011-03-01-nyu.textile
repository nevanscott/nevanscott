description: I worked with <a href="http://www.tyfujimura.com/">Ty Fujimura</a> and Nick Hughes on this site for NYU's Enterprise Learning Program, a joint continuing education program of the Polytechnic Institue of New York University (<a href="http://www.poly.edu/">NYU-Poly</a>) and the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies (<a href="http://www.scps.nyu.edu/">SCPS</a>).

    description: Programs can be filtered by degree offered and course location. We sweated the details of the design and interaction to make the process beautiful and intuitive. Subtle animations add clarity to the effect of the filters, and subtle visual changes in the filters themselves make it clear which are active.
