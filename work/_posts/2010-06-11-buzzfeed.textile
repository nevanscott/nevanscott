description: As part of some contract work for "Buzzfeed":http://www.buzzfeed.com/, I designed and implemented a new version of their mobile site optimized for the iPhone and Android platforms. We significantly pared down the feature set of the main site to create a focused experience for users on the go.

    description: I went with a very clean interface, informed by Buzzfeed's red and blue coloring and the emerging conventions around mobile sites. Everything was kept small so that load times would be fast even over slow cellular connections.
