    description: <p>I worked with the co-founder to keep the site simple and straight-forward in both design and content.</p><p>To complement the Trade Gothic logo, I decided to pair <a href="http://www.suitcasetype.com/index.php?part=fonts&font=26">Kulturista</a> from Suitcase Type Foundry with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/ff_tisa/">FF Tisa</a>.</p>
