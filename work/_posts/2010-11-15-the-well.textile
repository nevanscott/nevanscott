description: I worked with <a href="http://www.tyfujimura.com/">Ty Fujimura</a> to design and build out this website for a new publication focused on activities related to well-being - primarily nutrition, yoga, and meditation. With Ty's  direction, I fleshed out the design with room for photography to evoke the contents of the site. I then implemented the design and built out the necessary functionality on Expression Engine.

    description: We wanted a quick way for visitors to browse through all the sections from the homepage. I built these "infinite" sliders, which send new requests to Expression Engine to continue to pull content as you click on the arrows.
