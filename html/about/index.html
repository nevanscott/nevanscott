<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Nevan Scott, just like it says up top. I recently started a new job at <a href="http://arc90.com/">Arc 90</a>. (This is a big change. So far my third day is a Snow Day &#8211; why didn&#8217;t I get a Fire Day in L.A.? &#8211; and one of my co-workers prodded me to update my about page <a href="https://twitter.com/closacco/status/8911811265">via Twitter</a>.) For now, I&#8217;m staying with a friend in Harlem and looking for a new place to call home.</p>

<h3>About the Site</h3>
<p>This is where I sometimes try to write and show some of the projects I&#8217;ve been working on. I have a feed for my writing, if you like. I don&#8217;t employ any tracking, so if you like something here (or don&#8217;t) and want to get in touch, I always like getting emails at <script type="text/javascript">

<p>If you are using a modern browser on a desktop or laptop, you are probably reading this in Font Font&#8217;s Meta Serif Web Pro and Meta Web Pro. Meta was originally designed by Erik Spiekermann in 1986. In 2007, Font Font released Meta Serif as a companion to Meta, a collaboration of Erik Spiekermann, Christian Schwartz, and Kris Sowersby. (You may know <a href="http://christianschwartz.com/guardian.shtml">the beautiful work</a> Christian Schwartz did for <cite>The Gaurdian</cite> with Phil Barnes.)</p>
<p>I am still relatively new to <a href="http://typekit.com/">Typekit</a>, which is delivering these fine fonts. The service is worth looking into if you like typography and haven&#8217;t already explored it. You might also get some good mileage out of <a href="http://kernest.com/">Kernest</a> or <a href="http://fontsquirrel.com/">Font Squirrel</a>, especially if you prefer to serve your own fonts.</p>
<p>If you are on a device that Typekit doesn&#8217;t support, you&#8217;re in for a real treat: Matthew Carter&#8217;s beautiful Georgia and that old standby Helvetica. Georgia was designed specifically for the screen in the 90s and has stood well the test of time as screen resolutions have increased, pixels have gotten smaller, and display technologies have changed.</p>
<p>A special thanks to <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a> and others for their work on <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, which I use to generate the site from some intuitive source files.</p>
<p>For the purposes of laying out the site quickly, I&#8217;m relying on a grid stylesheet provided by <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a>, generated <a href="http://bgg.kematzy.com/">here</a>.</p>
