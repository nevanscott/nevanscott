				<h3><a href="/2010/10/roundup5/">Roundup No. 5</a></h3>
				<h4>Easy A</h4>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of better way to start than to whole-heartedly recommend the movie <cite>Easy A</cite>, currently out in theatres. Emma Stone is a pleasure, and the entire supporting cast is fantastic. Lisa Kudrow puts in a toned down performance with a wonderful flare for the dramatic and bitchy. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson were laugh out loud funny, and very touching in a way only possible in a high school comedy. The movie plays homage to its roots without getting too heavy about it, or too meta. Interestingly, the movie is framed with a YouTube confessional, which combined with the new electronic ways that gossip flits about the high school does a great job of showing us that times have changed but teenagers have not. A lot of fun, and required viewing for anyone who needs a bit of escape from the realities of Christian extremism.</p>
<h4>Write a Letter</h4>
<p>I used to write letters to friends in high school, and I have recently taken up doing so again. This subject matter probably deserves some more extensive consideration, but I wanted to plant the seed with anyone who may be reading. Writing a personal letter for an audience of one gives me a great feeling that is impossible to justify, but clearly exists. My writing feels sharper and more focused in letters because I know exactly who I&#8217;m writing for, and the pressure the write well is gone because a genuinely caring friend will be the only one with an opportunity to criticize.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also something really soothing about a bit of written communication going out to a friend that isn&#8217;t leaving digital traces all over a bunch of servers in God knows how many places in the world. Letters can be intercepted, but they give me a feeling of privacy. I&#8217;m not one to crave privacy in the sense that I don&#8217;t want others to know what is going on with me. But I do relish that privacy of shared intimate moments, and as odd as it may sound, a letter is one of those moments.</p>
<p>So I encourage you to write someone a letter. If you feel so inclined, you can even write me a letter. I just might write back.</p>
<h4>The Fork Test</h4>
<p>My friend Rebecca has started a new food blog called <a href="http://theforktest.wordpress.com/">The Fork Test</a>. In her <a href="http://theforktest.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/bravenewworld/">first post</a>, she writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cooking, for me, isn&#8217;t just a necessity anymore. It isn&#8217;t something I have to do because I don&#8217;t make enough money to do otherwise. It is now an active choice, something I <em>want</em> to do, time to myself I truly and utterly enjoy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have personally never developed any passion whatsoever for cooking, and am capable of making only two dishes: chili and pasta. I will be reading.</p>
<h4>David Foster Wallace, Continued</h4>
<p>In November 2003, <cite>The Believer</cite> published <a href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200311/?read=interview_wallace">an interview with David Foster Wallace</a> which is a really great read on the whole, mostly about his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393339289/"><cite>Everything and More</cite></a>. This one part in particular is probably one of my favorite points I&#8217;ve come across yet in Wallace&#8217;s writing:</p>
<aside>From Dave Eggers&#8217; intro: &#8220;Below is an email exchange with Wallace, though it wasn&#8217;t quite that. Questions were emailed to Wallace, who then took them home, answered them on his home computer&#8212;which is not connected to the Internet&#8212;printed those answers, and put them in the mail.&#8221;</aside>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;The big difference is that things are vastly more compartmentalized now than they were up through, say, the Renaissance. And more specialized, and more freighted with all kinds of special context. There&#8217;s no way we&#8217;d expect a world-class, cutting-edge mathematician now also to be doing world-class, cutting-edge philosophy, theology, etc. Not so for the Greeks&#8212;if only because math, philosophy, and theology weren&#8217;t coherently distinguishable for them. Same for the Neoplatonists and Scholastics, and etc. etc. (This is a very, very simple answer, of course, maybe right on the edge of simplistic.) By the time Cantor weighed in on &#8734; in the 1870s, it was part of an extremely specialized technical discipline that took decades to master and be able to do advanced work in. For Cantor and R. Dedekind (and now this is all just condensed way down from the book (sort of the same way the question is)), the math of &#8734; is derived as a way to solve certain thorny problems in post-calc analysis (viz., the expansions of trig functions and the rigorous definition of irrational numbers, respectively), which problems themselves derive from K. Weierstrass&#8217;s solutions to certain earlier problems, and so on. It&#8217;s all so abstract and specialized that large parts of E&amp;M end up getting devoted to unpacking the problems clearly enough so that a general reader can get a halfway realistic idea of where set theory and the topology of the Real Line even come from, mathematically speaking. The real point, I think, has to do with something else that ends up mentioned only quickly in the book&#8217;s final draft. We live today in a world where most of the really important developments in everything from math and physics and astronomy to public policy and psychology and classical music are so extremely abstract and technically complex and context-dependent that it&#8217;s next to impossible for the ordinary citizen to feel that they (the developments) have much relevance to her actual life. Where even people in two closely related sub-sub-specialties have a hard time communicating with each other because their respective s-s-s&#8217;s require so much special training and knowledge. And so on. Which is one reason why pop-technical writing might have value (beyond just a regular book-market $-value), as part of the larger frontier of clear, lucid, unpatronizing technical communication. It might be that one of the really significant problems of today&#8217;s culture involves finding ways for educated people to talk meaningfully with one another across the divides of radical specialization. That sounds a bit gooey, but I think there&#8217;s some truth to it. And it&#8217;s not just the polymer chemist talking to the semiotician, but people with special expertise acquiring the ability to talk meaningfully to us, meaning ordinary schmoes. Practical examples: Think of the thrill of finding a smart, competent IT technician who can also explain what she&#8217;s doing in such a way that you feel like you understand what went wrong with your computer and how you might even fix the problem yourself if it comes up again. Or an oncologist who can communicate clearly and humanly with you and your wife about what the available treatments for her stage-two neoplasm are, and about how the different treatments actually work, and exactly what the plusses and minuses of each one are. If you&#8217;re like me, you practically drop and hug the ankles of technical specialists like this, when you find them. As of now, of course, they&#8217;re rare. What they have is a particular kind of genius that&#8217;s not really part of their specific area of expertise as such areas are usually defined and taught. There&#8217;s not really even a good univocal word for this kind of genius&#8212;which might be significant. Maybe there should be a word; maybe being able to communicate with people outside one&#8217;s area of expertise should be taught, and talked about, and considered as a requirement for genuine expertise&#8230;. Anyway, that&#8217;s the sort of stuff I think your question is nibbling at the edges of, and it&#8217;s interesting as hell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think Wallace was tapping into something we all feel a need for. Listen to this stuff: &#8220;clear, lucid, unpatronizing technical communication.&#8221; I certainly could use more of that myself.</p>
<h4>Annals of Type</h4>
<p>I finally picked up an English translation of Jan Tschichold&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-Typography-Weimar-Now-Criticism/dp/0520250125/"><cite>The New Typography</cite></a>. The translation seems to pick up what I imagine must even in the German be Tschichold&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/hellbox/hellbox3.html">intense and engaging style</a>. In some ways, his mode of describing the past, present, and future in <cite>The New Typography</cite> remind me of some of Nietzsche&#8217;s writing on what he called the &#8220;new philosophers&#8221; and &#8220;philosophers of the future&#8221; in <cite>Beyond Good and Evil</cite>. For <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/nietzsche/1886/beyond-good-evil/ch06.htm">example</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critical discipline, and every habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters, will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of the future, they may even make a display thereof as their special adornment&#8212; nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that account. It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to have it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that &#8220;philosophy itself is criticism and critical science&#8212;and nothing else whatever!&#8221; Though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists of France and Germany (and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste of Kant: let us call to mind the titles of his principal works), our new philosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are instruments of the philosopher, and just on that account, as instruments, they are far from being philosophers themselves! Even the great Chinaman of Konigsberg was only a great critic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tschichold himself was a cultural critic:</p>
<aside><cite>Beyond Good and Evil</cite> was published in 1886, seventeen years before Tschichold was born. The Franco-Prussian War ended in 1871. The contemporary postwar period Tschichold refers to is following the First World War, during which time the German economy was in an enormous state of collapse. Explosive inflation ensued.</aside>
<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, new kinds of publications made possible by the new inventions, such as magazines and newspapers, emphasized the confusion in typographic design. When finally the process line-block was invented, and reproductive wood engraving, then at the highest point of its development, had to give way to it, confusion was complete. This state of affairs in printing was however only parallel with a general cultural collapse.</p>
<p>Germany especially, emerging victorious from the Franco-Prussian war, was flooded with machine-made substitutes for craftsmanship, that suited its megalomania which the victorious end of a war brought with it, and were enthusiastically taken up &#8211; indeed, people were actually proud of this tinniness. Like the profiteers of our own postwar period, people of that time had lost all sense of what was genuine; like us, they were blinded by the phoney glitter of those horrors.</p>
<p>The whole era is characterized on the one hand by a slavishly and entirely superficial copying of every conceivable old style, and on the other by a capriciousness in design without precedent. A town hall, for example, might be built to look like a pseudo-Gothic palace (Munich) or a &#8220;Romanesque&#8221; villa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it is nice to realize that technology, design, and culture have gone hand in hand (in hand) since well before computers or the web were really even imagined. How many pieces of modern software or websites can you think of that could be &#8220;characterized on the one hand by a slavishly and entirely superficial copying of every conceivable old style, and on the other by a capriciousness in design without precedent&#8221;? This text is still very much alive. See Khoi Vinh talking about <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2010/10/27/my-ipad-magazine-stand">bringing magazines to the iPad</a> only yesterday:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Adobe promise, as I understand it, is that publications can design for one medium and, with minimal effort, have their work product viably running on tablets and other media. It says: what works in print, with some slight modifications and some new software purchases, will work in new media. It&#8217;s a promise that we&#8217;ve heard again and again from many different software vendors with the rise of every new publishing platform, but it has never come to pass. And it never will.</p>

				<h3><a href="/2010/10/roundup4/">Roundup No. 4</a></h3>
				<h4>General Education</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading Louis Menand&#8217;s <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?id=6082"><cite>The Marketplace of Ideas</cite></a>. So far my favorite part is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Historical and theoretical knowledge, which is the kind of knowledge that liberal education disseminates, is knowledge that exposes the contingency of present arrangements. It unearths the a prioris buried in present assumptions; it shows students the man behind the curtain; it provides a glimpse of what is outside the box. It encourages students to think for themselves. Liberal educators know this, but sometimes they make the wrong inference. They think that showing the man behind the curtain subverts the spectacle. But merely revealing the contingency and constructedness of present arrangements does not end the spectacle, and subversiveness is not the point. The spectacle goes on. The goal of teaching students to think for themselves is not an empty sense of self-satisfaction. The goal is to enable students, after they leave college, to make more enlightened contributions to the common good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll repeat: &#8220;But merely revealing the continency and constructedness of present arrangements does not end the spectacle, and subversiveness is not the point.&#8221;</p>
<h4>&#8220;Grandaddy Justice&#8221;</h4>
<p>Back in September, Charlie Rose had on <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/11210">Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer</a>, who I have decided is my new best friend. Some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Charlie Rose</strong>: Why are things that you read like literature important to a judge?</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Breyer</strong>: I told a group of undergraduates here in New York a few weeks ago when I was asked that question. And I said it&#8217;s like knowing a foreign language or reading a novel. We only have one life. And we only really know our own. But by reading novels and by reading what other people have written about life, and about different ways of living, you can lead more lives than your own. And you can understand how people could have lived a quite different life. And that&#8217;s a wonderful privilege to be able to do that as well as I think a necessity for someone who&#8217;s going to affect the lives of other people.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Rose</strong>: So, somebody comes to you and says George Bush was not really elected president. The court simply issued a decree. You would say yes, he was, because the Supreme Court said he was.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Breyer</strong>: I would say better read the decisions, and I would also point out that one of the virtues that we have in this country is accepting decisions even when they&#8217;re very important and even when they&#8217;re wrong, rather than try to fight with guns to overturn them. And there are a lot of countries where that latter is a real alternative.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what I see in my office. I said, I&#8217;ve said this many times, but I see people of every race, every religion, every point of view. Every point of view and my mother used to say there is no view so crazy there isn&#8217;t somebody doesn&#8217;t hold it in this country. And these people who have very different points of view, outlook, et cetera, will decide under law. If you are going to decide under law, that means some people called judges will make these decisions. In difficult cases of interpretation, on the borders, all right. They&#8217;ll make mistakes sometimes.</p>
<p>So you have to decide you&#8217;re going to support an institution that will do things that are sometimes very unpopular. You have to decide that. I have to decide that. Very unpopular. And sometimes the judges will be wrong. And are you prepared to do that? And what I want to show people in this book is why they might be prepared to do it. And that&#8217;s &#8212; I tell some stories. And I try to explain how these decisions, many of them, current, how they look through my eyes. I can&#8217;t say I have the secret. I can say this is how I approach different areas and try to decide them. And I don&#8217;t call it politics. And I don&#8217;t call it just doing the good. And I certainly don&#8217;t call it deciding everything on the basis of some historical fact, you know, history is relevant.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Rose</strong>: You were willing to give the Congress some latitude.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Breyer</strong>: Uh-huh. Well, I put &#8212; this is not a real case. But I&#8217;m talking about statutes, I found a French railroad man, because there was a story in a French newspaper. And it said a biology &#8212; a teacher in a high school was bringing some snails, live snails in a basket on a train to Paris.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Rose</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Breyer</strong>: And the conductor came up and said you have to pay for a ticket, buy a ticket for the snails. And he said what? And the &#8212; he said read the tariff. It says you cannot bring animals unless you bring them in a basket and if you bring them in a basket, you have to buy a ticket. He said they didn&#8217;t mean snails, he said are snails animals? All right. There you have a statutory interpretation question.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Rose</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Breyer</strong>: Not so obvious. And why didn&#8217;t he make them buy 20 tickets? There were 20 snails. But I mean &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Rose</strong>: It is a way that you would approach that, so let&#8217;s assume that decision facing you.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Breyer</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Rose</strong>: The way you would approach that is you go back and see what legislative intent was.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Breyer</strong>: That&#8217;s right, I try to figure out why did they write this into the manual. What was the purpose of this rule. Didn&#8217;t it have something to do with insurance? Did the insurance have to do with snails? I mean, didn&#8217;t they really mean house pets?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Rose</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Breyer</strong>: And who wrote it and what they have in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the subtext of the conversation is, spend 16 years on the Supreme Court and you, too, will be able to speak in paragraph form.</p>
<h4>Annals of Type</h4>
<p>Hrant Papazian and Nina St&ouml;ssinger have started a new website devoted to Armenian Type called <a href="http://armenotype.com/">Armenotype</a>. Looks really promising, and the script is really beautiful. From St&ouml;ssinger&#8217;s <a href="http://armenotype.com/2010/10/type-and-culture/">&#8220;Type and Culture&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some Government officials in Yerevan call me their &laquo;ambassador&raquo; as I&#8217;ve been trying to raise the profile of the Armenian alphabet in &laquo;type circles&raquo; &#8211; with some success &#8211; and the last two issues of Baseline magazine feature my articles on the Armenian alphabet and type design &#8211; subjects never contained within this international journal in thirty years. I&#8217;ve assisted with some exhibitions in the UK of achievements in this field and was a judge in 2008 for the first &laquo;Granshan&raquo; international Armenian type design competition, held in Yerevan. This year the third Granshan was held in Dublin at the <a href="http://atypi.org/">ATypI </a>(Association Typographique Internationale) conference &#8211; the forum for the world&#8217;s type designers and typographers since 1957. There is talk of the 2012 conference being held in Yerevan&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking forward to more.</p>

				<h3><a href="/2010/09/roundup3/">Roundup No. 3</a></h3>
				<h4>The Social Sciences</h4>
<p>Jim Manzi offers an interesting <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/printable.php?id=6330">critique of the social sciences</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over many decades, social science has groped toward the goal of applying the experimental method to evaluate its theories for social improvement. Recent developments have made this much more practical, and the experimental revolution is finally reaching social science. The most fundamental lesson that emerges from such experimentation to date is that our scientific ignorance of the human condition remains profound. Despite confidently asserted empirical analysis, persuasive rhetoric, and claims to expertise, very few social-program interventions can be shown in controlled experiments to create real improvement in outcomes of interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He writes in fairly broad strokes, but I find myself wishing that there was more available constructive public debate over what the social sciences are, how they work, what they can tell us, and what the limitations are.</p>
<h4>Sarah Palin</h4>
<p><cite>Vanity Fair</cite> has published a piece on her by Michael Joseph Gross called <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2010/10/sarah-palin-201010?printable=true&amp;currentPage=1">&#8220;Sarah Palin: The Sound and the Fury&#8221;</a>. Not much new here, but worth the read to get a better sense of how removed she is even from her own neighbors.</p>
<h4>Current History</h4>
<p>Another September 11th has come and gone, and <cite>McSweeney&#8217;s</cite> has again published John Hodgman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2010/9/11hodgman.html">&#8220;Welcoming Remarks Made at a Literary Reading, 9/25/01&#8221;</a> by way of remembrance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every year, we wonder what might be appropriate on this day, and we can never think of anything more appropriate than this piece, which Mr. Hodgman originally delivered at a literary reading shortly after September 11, 2001.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t read the piece before this year, but I&#8217;m inclined to agree.</p>
<h4>Everything is OK, really.</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.viruscomix.com/monstrepancies.jpg">A gentle reminder</a> courtesy of my friend, Cori.</p>
<h4>Annals of Type</h4>
<p>I missed this last month: Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones announced a new font called <a href="http://www.typography.com/ask/showBlog.php?blogID=247">Forza</a>, based on rounded rectangular shapes. As usual, I love the colors on the <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100041">specimen page</a>. I&#8217;m especially fond of the slanted setting in the <a href="http://www.typography.com/images/overviewPageImages/forza_09.png">9th frame</a>. Seems like it would be a natural fit as a display face for a magazine. (Actually, it reminds me of <cite>Wired</cite> for some reason.)</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t miss the interview with <a href="http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow/18">Roger Black on <cite>The Big Web Show</cite></a> about web type and templates. Some of the fonts available through his new project <a href="http://www.webtype.com/">Webtype</a> look really great, especially the Clarendon-esque <a href="http://www.webtype.com/font/bentonmodernre-family/">BentonModernRE</a>. It would be nice if the specimens were set at a more comfortable reading width and with more breathing room between lines.</p>

				<h3><a href="/2010/08/roundup2/">Roundup No. 2</a></h3>
				<h4>Education</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve been watching and rewatching Sir Ken Robinson&#8217;s 2006 <span class="caps">TED</span> Talk <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">on creativity</a> in schools. Like most <span class="caps">TED</span> speakers, Robinson is very engaging, and blends in a good deal of humor with his commentary. His diagnosis is that our schools are designed with a hierarchy, with subjects like math and language at the top, and the arts at the bottom. Looking to the future, he vaguely points out that creativity is an asset we need to develop, more or less insinuating economic consequences for neglecting creative development. I think he is right that creativity needs more nurturing, but there is probably more to education than creating an economically viable society. We&#8217;re also people and individuals who need to navigate the waters of our humanity, and I don&#8217;t know a better companion than creativity.</p>
<p>Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman talk about the realities of teaching creativity in <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2010/07/10/the-creativity-crisis.html">&#8220;The Creativity Crisis&#8221;</a>, and make some good points. Math and science require a kind of creative thinking as well, and Bronson and Merryman outline a process of creative problem solving:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you try to solve a problem, you begin by concentrating on obvious facts and familiar solutions, to see if the answer lies there. This is a mostly left-brain stage of attack. If the answer doesn&#8217;t come, the right and left hemispheres of the brain activate together. Neural networks on the right side scan remote memories that could be vaguely relevant. A wide range of distant information that is normally tuned out becomes available to the left hemisphere, which searches for unseen patterns, alternative meanings, and high-level abstractions.</p>
<p>Having glimpsed such a connection, the left brain must quickly lock in on it before it escapes. The attention system must radically reverse gears, going from defocused attention to extremely focused attention. In a flash, the brain pulls together these disparate shreds of thought and binds them into a new single idea that enters consciousness. This is the &#8220;aha!&#8221; moment of insight, often followed by a spark of pleasure as the brain recognizes the novelty of what it&#8217;s come up with.</p>
<p>Now the brain must evaluate the idea it just generated. Is it worth pursuing? Creativity requires constant shifting, blender pulses of both divergent thinking and convergent thinking, to combine new information with old and forgotten ideas. Highly creative people are very good at marshaling their brains into bilateral mode, and the more creative they are, the more they dual-activate.</p>

<p>The idea of problem solving is an intriguing one, as it applies to creativity, and one common justification for edifying creative education is that all problems worth solving require a great amount of creative effort, whether they be social, political, scientific, or economic. Again, however, I wonder where creative work that is not as obviously about solving problems fits in. A wonderful dance piece may not be intended to solve an obvious problem. In my view, the problem being solved by a choreographer has to do with communicating something to another person.</p>
<p>Bronson and Merryman offer an inspiring story of a charter school in Akron, Ohio where students are set on a group project to propose plans for reducing noise in the library, learning about the relevant science and people skills along the way. The results are remarkable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two weeks ago, when the school received its results on the state&#8217;s achievement test, principal Traci Buckner was moved to tears. The raw scores indicate that, in its first year, the school has already become one of the top three schools in Akron, despite having open enrollment by lottery and 42 percent of its students living in poverty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of work requires dedicated educators, but as I recall it, my greatest learning experiences growing up had similar qualities. I learned material better when I was working on something that required that I understood it, rather than simply memorizing it for a test. The best way to learn Shakespeare is to perform it, the best way to learn programming is to write working programs. The best way to learn about ideas is probably to have to explain yours to someone else.</p>
<p>As far as math goes, Dan Meyer <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_meyer_math_curriculum_makeover.html">has some good ideas</a> along similar lines: make problems real (for real), and give students less of a framework to solve problems in so that they can build the framework themselves &#8211; an important step in solving hard problems is guessing how to break them down into pieces. Meyer calls it &#8220;patient problem solving&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I hope you can see. I really hope you can see how, what we&#8217;re doing here is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer, but we&#8217;re paving a smooth, straight path from one to the other, and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way. That&#8217;s all we&#8217;re doing here. So I want put to you, if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students, we can have everything we&#8217;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on his talk, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s possible the best way to learn the fundamentals of math (arithmetic, algebra, and calculus) is through explaining physical phenomena.</p>
<h4>Vanity Press</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m performing right now in a nice outdoor production of Susanna Centlivre&#8217;s <a href="http://bentquillplayers.weebly.com/"><cite>The Busybody</cite></a>, which has been very rewarding so far. (We close this weekend.) Richard Grayson came to last Saturday&#8217;s performance, and wrote <a href="http://who-will-kiss-the-pig.blogspot.com/2010/08/saturday-evening-in-washington-heights.html">a wonderful overview and review</a>. My friends Raney Cumbow and Meaghan Cross put together this venture, with Raney directing and Meaghan performing, along with more friends old and new. It has been a delight.</p>
<h4>Pleasure Viewing</h4>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen it, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1IxOS4VzKM">&#8220;Fuck Me, Ray Bradbury&#8221;</a> is something special. Bradbury himself <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/46222">seems to think so</a>.</p>
<h4>Annals of Type</h4>
<aside><span class="caps">ESPN</span>.com was also <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2003/06/espn-interview">one of the first major websites to be built using web standards</a> like <span class="caps">CSS</span> for layout.</aside>
<p>I recently came across this essay on <span class="caps">ESPN</span>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100805/madden">&#8220;The Franchise&#8221;</a> by Patrick Hruby. The essay itself is interesting, but I was excited to see a mainstream publisher like <span class="caps">ESPN</span> throwing their weight behind web-based editorial design. Outfits like Fray published online this way before the advent of content management systems hit full swing. Efforts have been going to revive it for a few years now, including Khoi Vinh and Liz Danzico&#8217;s <a href="http://abriefmessage.com/">A Brief Message</a> and Jason Santa Maria&#8217;s <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/">current website</a>. In introducing his new site in 2008, Santa Maria <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/a-new-day/">said</a>:</p>
<aside>The best art direction on Jason Santa Maria&#8217;s site is probably to be found in the <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/category/candygram/">Candygrams</a> he published for Halloween in 2009. Each piece was written by a guest author &#8211; I imagine that the spark of collaboration is what gives these pieces their special flavor.</aside>
<blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve made so many advancements in how we publish content that we haven&#8217;t looked back to what it is we&#8217;re actually creating. Many of us see the clear separation between things like print design and web design, but I&#8217;ve really been questioning the reality of why things are this way.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe it has as much to do with time and capabilities&#8212;the notion that it takes too long to achieve the same design fidelity we enjoy in slower print endeavors&#8212;I think it has more to do with us merely having convinced ourselves it does. We&#8217;ve developed so many ways of creating and coding websites faster, but we really haven&#8217;t scratched the surface for art directing them in that same light.</p>

<p>David Cole and Tag Savage started <a href="http://www.sleepoversf.com/">Sleepover</a> in the past year as &#8220;a very earnest attempt to make the world of online publishing better.&#8221; One service they offer is editorial design:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes content demands new forms, sometimes content is just so special it needs an extra layer of love. Sleepover can design individual articles or serial features to make the most of your content. We&#8217;ll work with your publishing system and draw on your existing design to expand the possibilities of your content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing so many of these art-directed essays (see <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100725/stadiumconcessions">here</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100630/tarponfishing">here</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100513/KermitAlexander">here</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100427/Haitisoccer">here</a>, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100407/tigerwoods">here</a>, and <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100218/myronrolle">here</a>) under ESPN&#8217;s &#8220;Outside the Lines&#8221; certainly encourages me to think that the &#8220;extra layer of love&#8221; may not be just a micro-niche of web design work for much longer.</p>

				<h3><a href="/2010/08/roundup1/">Roundup No. 1</a></h3>
				<h4>Creep</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of Facebook, and I haven&#8217;t been too interested in the upcoming movie either. However, the trailer grabbed me, I think mostly due to the use of a really great cover of Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;Creep&#8221;. Thankfully, Zeldman <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2010/08/13/social-network-creep/">had my back</a>, and found the group that did the beautiful choral cover:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re intrigued, as I am, by the trailer for David Fincher&#8217;s upcoming <cite><a href="http://www.thesocialnetwork-movie.com/">The Social Network</a></cite>, and if part of what compels you about the trailer is the musical score &#8211; a choral version of Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;Creep&#8221; &#8211; you&#8217;ll be happy to know you can purchase said song via emusic.com: <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/Scala-On-The-Rocks-MP3-Download/10969086.html">On The Rocks</a> is the album, &#8220;Creep&#8221; is the track, and Scala, a Belgian all-teenage-girl choir, are the artists. Highly recommended.</p>
</blockquote>
<aside>This also brings to mind James Houston&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1109226">cover of &#8220;Nude&#8221;</a> from 2008.</aside>
<p>There&#8217;s something really wonderful about a song about loneliness and apartness being performed in unison by a group of singers. The sound is haunting in a way, and some of the melodic changes create great tension.</p>
<h4>This is Nice</h4>
<p><a href="http://kottke.org/">Jason Kottke</a> took a vacation for a couple of weeks, and had Tim Carmody of <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/">Snarkmarket</a> stand in the past week. (I kind of love that Jason does this.) Tim absolutely tore it up. My favorite recent find, though, was in a guest post the week before by <a href="http://www.unlikelywords.com/">Aaron Cohen</a>. Aaron <a href="http://kottke.org/10/08/kurt-vonneguts-advice-to-young-writers">posted</a> video of a talk Kurt Vonnegut gave at Albion College in 2002. (On Youtube starting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbOFYWbVVz8">here</a>.) The great takeaway line from the speech is a gem of optimism: &#8220;If this isn&#8217;t nice, what is?&#8221;</p>
<h4>David Foster Wallace</h4>
<p>Continuing on a David Foster Wallace streak, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html?pagewanted=all">&#8220;Federer as Religious Experience&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/04/host/3812/">&#8220;Host&#8221;</a> are both good reads. From the Federer piece:</p>
<aside>A nice addition to &#8220;Federer&#8221; is probably Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s 1999 essay <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/1999/1999_08_02_a_genius.htm">&#8220;The Physical Genius&#8221;</a>.</aside>
<blockquote>
<p>By way of illustration, let&#8217;s slow things way down. Imagine that you, a tennis player, are standing just behind your deuce corner&#8217;s baseline. A ball is served to your forehand &#8212; you pivot (or rotate) so that your side is to the ball&#8217;s incoming path and start to take your racket back for the forehand return. Keep visualizing up to where you&#8217;re about halfway into the stroke&#8217;s forward motion; the incoming ball is now just off your front hip, maybe six inches from point of impact. Consider some of the variables involved here. On the vertical plane, angling your racket face just a couple degrees forward or back will create topspin or slice, respectively; keeping it perpendicular will produce a flat, spinless drive. Horizontally, adjusting the racket face ever so slightly to the left or right, and hitting the ball maybe a millisecond early or late, will result in a cross-court versus down-the-line return. Further slight changes in the curves of your groundstroke&#8217;s motion and follow-through will help determine how high your return passes over the net, which, together with the speed at which you&#8217;re swinging (along with certain characteristics of the spin you impart), will affect how deep or shallow in the opponent&#8217;s court your return lands, how high it bounces, etc. These are just the broadest distinctions, of course &#8212; like, there&#8217;s heavy topspin vs. light topspin, or sharply cross-court vs. only slightly cross-court, etc. There are also the issues of how close you&#8217;re allowing the ball to get to your body, what grip you&#8217;re using, the extent to which your knees are bent and/or weight&#8217;s moving forward, and whether you&#8217;re able simultaneously to watch the ball and to see what your opponent&#8217;s doing after he serves. These all matter, too. Plus there&#8217;s the fact that you&#8217;re not putting a static object into motion here but rather reversing the flight and (to a varying extent) spin of a projectile coming toward you &#8212; coming, in the case of pro tennis, at speeds that make conscious thought impossible. Mario Ancic&#8217;s first serve, for instance, often comes in around 130 m.p.h. Since it&#8217;s 78 feet from Ancic&#8217;s baseline to yours, that means it takes 0.41 seconds for his serve to reach you. This is less than the time it takes to blink quickly, twice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Full of great stuff. &#8220;Host&#8221; covers a conservative radio host, and as usual Wallace applies an impressively even hand without hiding his personal opinion. Especially interesting considering this is journalistic coverage of another medium, and it would have been easy to fall into a lot of traps. He seems to super-humanly avoid them by being strikingly human.</p>
<h4>Life Sucks, Let&#8217;s Laugh</h4>
<p>From the I Can Relate Department, Owen Morris&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2010/8/13morris.html">&#8220;The 27 Levels of Compatibality I&#8217;m Looking For&#8221;</a> and Brandon Lueken&#8217;s <a href="http://bygonebureau.com/2010/08/16/diary-of-unemployment/">&#8220;A Diary of Unemployment&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been working recently with playwright Isaac Oliver on a project. Turns out he has a great blog, <a href="http://hewholaughs.com/">He Who Laughs, or The Complete Idiot&#8217;s Guide to Intimacy</a>. I especially like his dialogue-heavy posts, both real (<a href="http://hewholaughs.com/2010/07/30/new-york-moment-49/">&#8220;New York Moment&#8221;</a>) and imagined (<a href="http://hewholaughs.com/2010/07/25/half-price/">&#8220;Half-price&#8221;</a>). Given my own dislike of <cite>Inception</cite>, I really appreciated Isaac&#8217;s masterful takedown, <a href="http://hewholaughs.com/2010/07/29/totem-poled/">&#8220;Totem-poled&#8221;</a>.</p>
<h4>I Love Denis O&#8217;Hare</h4>
<p>He&#8217;s playing the power-hungry vampire Russell Edgington on this season of <cite>True Blood</cite>. It is possibly worth watching the entire show just for his spectacular performance. (He&#8217;s up there with my other recent favorite bad guy performance, Hans Landa played by Christoph Waltz in <cite>Inglourious Basterds</cite>.) O&#8217;Hare plays the part with such energy and relish, it is sheer joy to watch him work. The speech he gives at the end of this week&#8217;s episode was a special treat worth rewatching.</p>
<h4>No Words</h4>
<p>This week&#8217;s episode of Radiolab, <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2010/09/10">&#8220;Words&#8221;</a> is pretty great. Up there with <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2006/04/21">&#8220;Musical Language&#8221;</a>. Definitely some thought-provoking material, although I always find myself wishing they would tie the ideas presented in the shows back to some philosophical or historical or other text, since usually the ideas aren&#8217;t what&#8217;s new, the evidence is.</p>
<h4>Annals of Type</h4>
<p>The big news is that <a href="http://blog.typekit.com/2010/08/16/typekit-and-adobe/">Adobe has partnered with Typekit</a>. I&#8217;m excited to play around more with Chaparral, Minion, and Myriad in particular. This is definitely a mjor score for Typekit, but there was another big win for them that made smaller waves. Mandy Brown <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/roots/">announced today</a> that she is joining the Typekit team. Congratulations to her and to Typekit. (Looks like her site is down as I write this, I imagine she&#8217;s swapping out Cuf&oacute;n for the newly-available Typekit-served Chaparral.)</p>
