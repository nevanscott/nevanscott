				<h3>&#8220;Bad&#8221; Television</h3>
				<p>For a number of years now, I&#8217;ve been a regular viewer of some undoubtedly consider pretty terrible TV shows. I think it may have started when I got hooked on <cite>Brothers &amp; Sisters</cite>, but the list has now grown to include shows like <cite>Cupid</cite>, <cite>Greek</cite>, and <cite>Cougar Town</cite>. I honestly have no idea if any of these shows could ever qualify for anything akin to critical acclaim or even popular recognition. (<cite>Brothers &amp; Sisters</cite> is fairly popular&#8230; right?) But I <em>have</em> watched just about every episode of these shows to date. So of course I have an opinion about them.</p>
<p>The first thing to say is that when I first got into <cite>Brothers &amp; Sisters</cite> &#8211; after a marathon viewing of the first season in Carlisle, PA &#8211; I told people only tentatively that I watched the show. And when I did, I described it as my &#8220;guilty pleasure.&#8221; Why? Well, for one thing, I like people to think that I&#8217;m generally self-respecting, and I imagined that most people I was in regular contact with (read Sarah Lawrence students) would think that no self-respecting person could possibly be interested in such a show.</p>
<p>The real question, though, is why did I imagine that to be the case? What is so <em>bad</em> about <cite>Brothers &amp; Sisters?</cite> My first thought was essentially that it seemed to be an evening soap. Okay, people don&#8217;t like soaps, but what did that mean? That the show is somehow especially melodramatic and that all the story-lines involve lots of twists intended to jerk the audience around?</p>
