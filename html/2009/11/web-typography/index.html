				<h3>Web Typography 0.30</h3>
				<p>The practice of setting type on the web is not fundamentally different from setting type for any other medium. The differences that do exist are primarily technical; many of these technical differences between the web and print are all-too-often considered limitations of web design. I disagree. While it is true that web typography in its current form lacks some of the nuances available to, say, book designers, I believe the canvas of the web itself opens doors to new possibilities in the practice of making beautiful and readable text. In this essay, I will attempt to share some of my enthusiasm for the possibilities available to web-bound typographers, and describe some of the technical details that can empower those who want their web designs to have a strong typographical voice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could begin with the crab that scratches in the sand. The name of the animal is the action or sound it makes, or its color. The name parents other like meanings belonging to other things, leaving the animal behind: grapho (Greek &#8211; to scratch, and so, to write), gramma (the scratches), graph, grammar, grab.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="drop">The art of typography exists to honor the more ancient arts of writing and recording. As with calligraphy before it, and carving before that, one might easily wonder if there is anything to typography beyond the aesthetic. What is the point of studying typography? In some ways, typography may seem even more meaningless to the average writer than calligraphy or carving were. After all, carving out a text or scraping marks on a page require direct manipulation of individual letterforms. Anyone who has ever learned to write knows that there is at least some skill required in shaping strokes into characters.</p></p>
<p>The typist knows no such difficulty, especially if their instrument is a typewriter. There is but one way to type &lsquo;Love&rsquo; on an old Olivetti. Lovers everywhere know that there are a million ways to sign off an intimate letter. On a computer screen, there is still only one way to type a word, but there are plenty of ways to alter its presentation, including font, size, spacing, color and a variety of other options made available in desktop publishing since the 1980s.</p>
<p>In a simplistic view of things, presentation is precisely the domain of the typographer. In elementary school, we already form opinions about the relationship between content and presentation; why, we think, must our handwriting be nice, if our story comes across in what the words mean and not how they look? (If you think about it, this is a sophisticated distinction that all children learning to write make.) The answer we&rsquo;re given is often a rhetorical question: how will others (here the teacher is implied) be able to read your work if it doesn&rsquo;t look good?</p>
<p>In many ways, typography extends this thinking to a science. Still, legibility is not a matter of good and evil. At a certain level of proficiency, all handwriting is understood to be &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;. In fact, in the American school system, the notion of ideal handwriting (calligraphy, in other words) is obsolete in favor of individualized handwriting. If you wish, consider this the work of relativism on primary education. Most of us learn to acheive a balance between the quality of our script and the speed with which we execute it, sacrificing legibility and, in turn, readability, for speed.</p>
<p>As with anything that can be mass manufactured, the economics of writing changes with scale. Writing a story by hand is more like carving a pumpkin than designing a coffeemaker.</p>
<h2>Measure</h2>
<p><em>Measure</em> refers to the width of a block of text. On a printed page, the measure is constrained by the page width. A browser window has no such limitation. However, for the sake of readability, it is important to carefully choose your measure.</p>
<div class="times">
<p class="left two example-box" style="font-size: small; line-height: 1.5em;">Very narrow blocks are really only useful for short bits of text, and usually call for a smaller size and tighter leading.</p>
<p class="left five last example-box" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.7em;">On the web, the nice thing about setting copy with a wide measure is that it becomes more acceptable to allow the browser to justify the text. Currently, browsers cannot hyphenate based on a dictionary, and justification is typically achieved only by varying the spacing between words. Inter-character and even inter-glyph spacing will be required before browsers can truly render acceptable justified text. Remember when setting a wide measure to increase the leading to improve readability.</p>
<p class="left four example-box">A comfortable measure for reading on a printed page typically comes in at around 66 characters per line. There are a variety of eye-tracking studies which make approximately the same recommendation for the screen. I find that the sweet spot is typically between 45 and 80 chracters per line. This one is a little on the wide side, but is perfectly readable, and would be across several paragraphs. Because there is room for it on the web, I tend to err on the wide side, especially for writing that makes use of longer paragraphs.</p>
<p class="left three last example-box" style="line-height: 1.4em;">This block is still narrower than a typical block meant for reading. For short paragraphs, however, narrow blocks like this can be easy to scan, newspaper-style. Narrower-than-usual measure calls for tighter-than-usual leading.</p>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h2>Fonts</h2>
<p>Many designers transitioning to the web from the world of print are frustrated by the lack of options regarding typeface choice on the web. There are so few options because only a handful of fonts are reliably availabe on most computers. Below are the most commonly available.</p>
<h4 class="left one">Sans Serifs</h4>
<p class="left two small arial example-box"><strong>Arial</strong> is a sturdy go-to font for a modern and readable look. Arial is generally considered a cheap knock-off of Helvetica, designed for Microsoft.</p>
<p class="left two small verdana example-box"><strong>Verdana</strong> was designed by the Carter in the 90s for Microsoft. Its quirky appearance is a result of creating a sans serif specifically for the screen.</p>
<p class="left two small last lucidagrande example-box"><strong>Lucida Grande</strong> is a great sans serif with a natural feel, and a flexibility regarding weight and size on the web. Watch out though, it doesn&rsquo;t include an italic!</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h4 class="left one">Serifs</h4>
<p class="left two small times example-box"><strong>Times</strong> is probably the single most familiar font for typists everywhere. It often gets short shrift in web design, but there is actually a lot of too-often-ignored possibility in this vanilla face.</p>
<p class="left two small timesnewroman example-box"><strong>Times New Roman</strong> has fairly subtle differences from Times, but in my opinion is even more generic-looking. For reference, check out an italic lowercase z.</p>
<p class="left two small last georgia example-box"><strong>Georgia</strong> is a wildly popular web font, and probably the most readable wide-spread screen font out there. Carter designed it too.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>And on with the story. This is obviously another paragraph and this is just another sentence to try to make this paragraph resemble one of reasonable length. Soon maybe I can start writing actual paragraphs instead of fillers.</p>
<div class="left three indent-one small arial example-box">
<h3>Arial</h3>
<p>Arial is generally considered the poor man&rsquo;s Helvetica. Helvetica has a proud history in graphic design, tied to the modernist movement, and even inspired the first documentary feature about a typeface. Arial is essentially a cheap imitation commissioned by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Like its more sophisticated progenitor, Arial&rsquo;s primary virtue &ndash; its lack of personailty &ndash; is also its primary flaw. As a clean sans-serif, Arial looks very modern, and generally makes the statement, &ldquo;I am not making a statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arial makes for only decently readable paragraphs. It shines when used at small sizes for captions, sidenotes, and references, or at medium-to-large sizes for headlines and other items meant primarily for scanning and not reading (try bold).</p>
</div>
<div class="left three last small verdana example-box">
<h3 class="indent-one" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 3em; line-height: 1em; letter-spacing: -.1em;">Verdana</h3>
<p class="left three indent-one small">Except at very small sizes, Verdana is basically ugly. At fairly large sizes, Verdana bold acquires an interestingness. Verdana bold italic <em>never</em> looks good. Verdana is best used for small bits of information or for small body copy.</p>
<p class="left three last small">Verdana was a much more important web font ten, or even five years ago. As screens have gotten larger, readable tiny fonts are less needed. On-screen text anti-aliasing has also caused Verdana to lose a lot of the edge it once had.</p>
</div>
<p><br class="clear" /></p>
<div class="left three indent-one small lucidagrande example-box">
<h3 class="indent-one" style="font-weight: bold;">Lucida Grande</h3>
<p class="small">Lucida Grande has two great things going for it. Of the sans serifs available, I would argue that Lucida Grande is the most readable for body copy. Also, it has a subtle <strong>bold weight</strong>, which makes for effective emphasis despite Lucida Grande&rsquo;s lack of an italic. The bold is also great for titles.</p>
<p class="small">Lucida Grande seems to work best when using a subtle range of font sizes, where Verdana is good for mixing the large and small. This makes Lucida Grande good for a site whose design needs to fade further into the background.</p>
</div>
<div class="left three last small times example-box">
<h3>Times</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it (ha!) &ndash; Times is pretty boring as far as fonts go. Because of its lackluster appeal, Times is <em>incredibly</em> difficult to use effectively. But it can be done!</p>
<p class="left two small"><span class="caps">NOTE</span>: This section needs to be completely rewritten. It&rsquo;s too weirdly specific with virtually no backup.</p>
<p>Times is OK for body copy. It is actually quite readable, but it is difficult for a reader to get past the fact that they are reading text in the default Word font. Times was so overused, particularly in the 90s, that it has forged a deep association in our minds with the most boring things we&rsquo;ve ever read. As much as I love reading the <a href="http://newyorker.com/"><cite>New Yorker</cite></a>, I still find it annoying to read their pristine prose in the tired Times variant, Times New Roman.</p>
<p>Not only is Times the default Word font, it is also the default font for most web browsers. This is a strong blow against it, because it is an uphill battle to make a site set in Times look like its design has been fully thought-out.</p>
<p>Where Times fails the <cite>New Yorker</cite>, it serves <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/"><cite>McSweeney&rsquo;s</cite></a> to a T. <cite>McSweeney&rsquo;s</cite> succeeds with Times for a couple of reasons. First, it uses the measure of a column of newspaper copy &ndash; a medium in which a font like Times simply fits. It also mixes things up by pushing the limits on the letter-spacing of it all-caps titles. Moreover, <cite>McSweeney&rsquo;s</cite> uses dark green as a perfect color for the font.</p>
</div>
<p><br class="clear" /></p>
<div class="left three indent-one small georgia example-box">
<h3>Georgia</h3>
<p>I have made no secret in the past about my unabiding love for Matthew Carter&rsquo;s Georgia, so I will make no secret of it here. I will, however, attempt to defend it.</p>
<p>The primary reason I like using Georgia, is because I personally find it to be the most readable font available on the web. I do not seem to be alone in this thinking. Some of the most reading-heavy websites on the web employ Georgia for their body copy &ndash; <a href="http://nytimes.com/"><cite>The New York Times</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/"><cite>The Atlantic</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/"><cite>Time</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/"><cite>Vanity Fair</cite></a>, and <a href="http://www.wired.com/"><cite>Wired</cite></a> to name just a few.</p>
<p>Point the second: <em>Georgia has a wonderful italic for emphasis or distinction</em>. The italic is also highly readable, and works at any size.</p>
<p>Georgia is the only available font to use text figures &ndash; 1234567890 &ndash; that is, numerals that mix well with regular upper and lowercase text. For some, this alone is reason enough to use Georgia for body copy.</p>
</div>
<h2>Pairing Fonts</h2>
<p>Due to the small number of fonts available to web designers, it is possible to go into a fair amount of detail regarding the mixing of fonts. In this section, I will discuss choosing and using pairs of available fonts.</p>
<p>In any form &ndash; be it book, dinner menu, emergency exit instructions, poster, etc. &ndash; precision usage of two fonts is a fairly common practice in graphic design. And with good reason. Using two fonts adds some often-needed variety that a single font cannot pull off on its own. On the other hand, using more than two fonts can cause a design to lose focus and feel a bit potpourri. In other words, using two fonts on a page provides an effective balance between plainness and decadence.</p>
<p>Aside from the aesthetic variety offered by using a pair of fonts, on the web there is also a practical reason for opting to use more than one font. In general, all fonts have limitations. On the web, it is rare to find oneself in a situation where one font can effectively be used for all the needs of a given page. Some fonts are better-suited to titles than to copy, for example. A pair of fonts can cover a wider range of use cases.</p>
<div class="left three indent-one example-box">
<div class="large arial bold">Arial and Lucida Grande</div>
<div class="small lucidagrande">Try using Arial Bold for titles with Lucida Grande for body. You may find that they go surprisingly well together. Both have a modern, clean feel. As far as readablitiy goes, I consider it a win-win-win-win: Arial works better for titles than for body; Lucida Grande works better for body than for titles; titles look cleaner in Arial than in Lucida Grande; and body is easier to read in Lucida Grande than in Arial. I prefer to use Arial Bold in this pairing, so as to further differentiate the two.</div>
</div>
<div class="left three last example-box">
<div class="large georgia">Georgia and Lucida Grande</div>
<div class="small lucidagrande">Pairing body set in Lucida Grande with Georgia titles also works well. The quirkiness of Georgia can bring out some of the same quality in Lucida Grande. To me, this pairing has a uniquely &ldquo;webby&rdquo; feel to it. I think this has to do with the fact that in any other medium it would be highly unconventional to mix serif titles with sanserif text. All in all, I&rsquo;d argue that this combo lends text a rather precious feel, making it great for well-considered language wherever it may lurk.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="left three indent-one example-box">
<div class="large arial bold">Arial and Georgia</div>
<div class="small georgia">Headers set in Arial Bold mixed with Georgia body copy makes for a classic and sleek look. This is a pretty powerful combination, especially for &ldquo;templates&rdquo; &ndash; designs that need to be flexible enough to work with a wide variety of content.</div>
</div>
<div class="left three last example-box">
<div class="large verdana bold tight">Verdana and Georgia</div>
<div class="small georgia">Mixing Verdana with Georgia usually works out pretty well, if only because both faces were designed by Matthew Carter. Both were designed with generous x-heights, so they both feel fairly big and open.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="left three indent-one example-box">
<div class="large georgia">Georgia and Verdana</div>
<div class="small verdana">Georgia and Verdana also work well the other way around, with Georgia for titles and Verdana for body. This gives a fairly similar effect as Georgia and Lucida Grande, but the use of Verdana makes the text feel more casual than the crisp forms of Lucida Grande allows.</div>
</div>
<div class="left three last example-box">
<div class="large georgia">Georgia and Arial</div>
<div class="small arial">You can use Georgia and Arial in reverse as well. The only porblem with doing this is that, generally speaking, Arial doesn&rsquo;t serve as a capable font for reading. This combination works well when you only need small chunks of text, like for a short-form blog of link-blog.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h2>Color</h2>
<div class="box" style="background-color: #03C; color: #FFF;">
<p>White text of sufficiently large size is actually pretty readable on a variety of sufficiently contrasting background colors, such as this bright blue.</p>
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="box" style="background-color: #000;">
<p style="color: #FFF;">Generally speaking, white text on a black background is hard on the eyes because of the high contrast.</p>
<p style="color: #CCC;">When working with a black matte on the web, it is easy to reduce the contrast and eye strain by simply using a light shade of grey for the text instead of pure white. This offers the same color and contrast effect, but is easier to read. Most readers won&rsquo;t even be able to tell they aren&rsquo;t looking at white text without the white text to compare the grey to.</p>
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="box" style="background-color: #111; color: #FFF;">
<p>When I want an inverse color scheme on the web, however, I prefer to set white text on dark grey. To my eyes, white on grey is much easier to read than either white on black or grey on black.</p>
<p>However, unlike above, where it is difficult to tell that the grey text is not white, a swath of dark grey is pretty noticably not black.</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="box" style="background-color: #353; color: #FFF;">
<p>Similarly, white text is typically more readable on muted colors than on louder colors, especially for long stretches.</p>
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="box" style="background-color: #F30; color: #FFF;">
<p>On a louder color, it is difficult to settle into the text.</p>
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="box" style="background-color: #886;">
<p style="color: #FFF;">Mid-range neutrals have a special flexibility as background colors because they can support both light and dark text.</p>
<p style="color: #000;">It is difficult for the brain to switch from reading in one color to a contrasting color. You can actually use this to your advantage when fashioning a page with more than one reading zone, readers will be less distracted by additional content on a page if it is set in a contrasting color to what they are currently reading.</p>
</div>
<p style="color: #000;">The most obvious choice for body text is to set it in black on white, the basic standard for everything from books to newspapers to magazines. Indeed, when those publications carry themselves onto the web, they typically use black text on solid white.</p>
<p>The rules regarding light text on dark don&rsquo;t exactly apply in reverse to dark text on light. There is an advantage to lowering the contrast by, for example, using dark grey text on white, although this is more a matter of taste than of readability.</p>
<div class="box" style="background-color: #CCC; color: #000;">
<p>The other option for lowering the contrast &ndash; black text on light grey &ndash; is in some ways a great boon to readability, but can make a page feel awkward and heavy.</p>
</div>
<p><br /></p>
<div class="box" style="background-color: #99C; color: #000;">
<p>Some of this awkwardness can be avoided by using a light color as a background, instead of a light grey. On the web light grey backgrounds look tired and lazy. A color looks like a choice.</p>
</div>
<p style="color: #C00;">As a matter of convention, do <em>not</em> use colored text on the web.</p>
<p>As with underlining, text coloring is really reserved for hyperlinks on the web. Colored text <em>can</em> sometimes be used for emphasis, but it&rsquo;s a dicey game, and usually only works for marketing copy, and even then will induce most users to try to click to see if the colored text is a link.</p>
<p>Why not a whole page of colored text then? Honestly, I have only lack of evidence to support my claim that this is not a good idea. Find me a website that is handsome and easy to read whose copy is set entirely in colored text (on any background), and I will gladly amend my point of view.</p>
<h2>Grid</h2>
<div class="grid">
<p>This is what the typographic grid looks like when used for a website. Using a grid is a common technique for laying out a page in a logically coherent way, making it easy for the reader or user to find what they are looking for and understand what they are looking at.</p>
<p class="right one small">Grids are fairly pervasive in web design today. I see this less as a trend and more as a step forward in the sophistication process.</p>
<p>Grids are actually fairly easy to grasp and don&rsquo;t require much in the way of explanation. Most people are already hinting at using a grid as a design tool when they attempt to make things &ldquo;line up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="left three small"><em>Grids need not be completely rigid. Allowing content to break out of its allotted space and into another&rsquo;s can add visual interest.</em></p>
<p>The basics are these: columns and gutters. Text (and images) can take up any number of columns and abutt the gutters. This way, the gutters leave space between blocks of content. Also content all falls along a small set of (invisible) vertical lines, making it easier for the brain to recognize relationships between information and navigate the page quickly and efficiently.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p></div><!-- /grid --></p>
<div class="grid">
<h4 class="left one">Organization</h4>
<p class="left two">Columns can be grouped in various ways to express different organizations of information.</p>
<p class="left two">For example, three blocks of text of equal weight placed side by side will naturally have equal weight.</p>
<p class="left two last">This is a good technique to employ when discreet chunks of equally-important information need to be quickly scannable.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p></div><!-- /grid --></p>
<div class="grid">
<p class="left four indent-one">A common layout for a simple website is to have a main content area and a sidebar. These fit naturally into the structure of a grid. But the grid offers something that the simple layout does not &ndash; added flexibility. Too many sites stick to the header-footer-content-sidebar paradigm, possibly a holdover from the thankfully bygone days of table-based layout on the web. A simple way to adjust that paradigm is to set a grid foundation and sketch the outlines of those four main blocks. Then use the established grid to consider new ways of thinking about the layout within those four basic blocks.</p>
<p class="left two last small">Typically, the sidebar is narrower than the main content of a page&rsquo;s layout. However, it doesn&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to be as narrow as you might think. Using a wider sidebar allows for some layout flexibility &ndash; for example, a list of links organized into two columns.</p>
<p class="left four indent-one">In the header, for example, try aligning the title and subtitle to different columns. Fix the search box to align with the established grid. Play with splitting up navigation elements into groups and line those up with different verticals.</p>
<p class="left four indent-one">The footer probably has the most room for play, because it is a treat for a reader or user who has bothered to get to the bottom of your site. <span class="right two small">In the content block, consider using asides and pull-quotes. Especially on the web, it is often nice to a reader to sometimes break up the wall of text.</span> In many cases, it makes sense to include a dense amount of information about a site in its footer. A good footer might include an extra set of navigational links, offer alternative ways to navigate a site, provide a description of the site for visitors who have entered through the back or side door, deliver links to popular content, or invite the visitor to try out some related websites. Often, these features are a natural fit for a non-hierarchical layout, which is where column groupings can shine.</p>
