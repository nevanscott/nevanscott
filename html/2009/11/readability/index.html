<h3>David Pogue on Cleaning Up the Clutter Online</h3>

<p>I believe I agree with the sentiment <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/cleaning-up-the-clutter-online/">here</a> regarding ads, especially on pages that are intended for reading.</p>
<p>As for <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a>, I wish that it were an unnecessary tool. It is a much more difficult project to try to educate writers and designers and readers about typographic treatment on the web. It is more work for the standards makers and browser builders to devise, agree on, and implement ways for type to be treated far more intelligently on the web. But it&#8217;s worth it, because even though there are rules and guidelines to making texts more readable, writing will never be one-design-fits-all.</p>
<p>So, David Pogue, I know you&#8217;re listening. Take on this cause! If people are responding to you so well on Twitter, point them in the direction of <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/indefenseofreaders/">something</a> <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/unreadable/">by</a> <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/">Mandy Brown</a>. The best way to tackle the readability of the web isn&#8217;t by trying to automatically reformat it (although it&#8217;s a good stop-gap). No! We need to raise awareness to push the community of people who write for and publish online to take the extra care to make words readable.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help. :)</p>
