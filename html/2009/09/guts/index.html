<h3>The Guts of a New Machine</h3>

<p>Came across this again while digging through the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">DF</a> archives. Rob Walker <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/magazine/30IPOD.html?pagewanted=all">profiles the then-two-year-old iPod</a> for the <cite>Times</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A handful of familiar cliches have made the rounds to explain this &#8212; it&#8217;s about ease of use, it&#8217;s about Apple&#8217;s great sense of design. But what does that really mean? &#8220;Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like,&#8221; says Steve Jobs, Apple&#8217;s C.E.O. &#8220;People think it&#8217;s this veneer &#8212; that the designers are handed this box and told, &#8216;Make it look good!&#8217; That&#8217;s not what we think design is. It&#8217;s not just what it looks like and feels like. <em>Design is how it works</em>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>This idea has, I think, taken root since then, and a respect for the relationship between usability, readability, and visual character on the web in particular has really grown. And yet, some companies seem to continue to try to &#8220;copy Apple&#8221; in all the wrong ways, drawing the wrong inferences, and learning the wrong lessons.</p>
<p>Think about what you&#8217;re making, respect the user and the reader, and make informed decisions along the way to the best of your ability. Setting everything minimally against a white background is not the great lesson of Apple&#8217;s success. The takeaway is to place an emphasis on the user in the design process and not to underestimate the value of quality.</p>
