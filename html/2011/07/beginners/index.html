				<p>A couple of weeks ago, I received this email from a friend:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nevan,</p>

  <p>Drop what you are doing, get yourself to a cinema<sup id="fnref:beginners1"><a href="#fn:beginners1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and see Beginners. (You can thank me later.)</p>

  <p>[Redacted]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, it&rsquo;s hard to say no to something like that, and I decided it was a great opportunity to go see a movie I had no pre-impressions of. (This method had worked great several years ago when some high school friends dragged me to <cite>American Splendor</cite>.) So I put it in my mind that I&rsquo;d go see it soon.</p>

<p>A couple of days later, I happened to walk by the poster for <cite>Beginners</cite>, somewhat ruining my plan to go in knowing nothing. All I took in were the actors. <em>Oh!</em>, I thought, trying not to look too closely at the poster for the movie I was trying to remain ignorant about. <em>Ewan McGregor, Christopher Plummer, and that actress from <cite>Cashback</cite>. Certainly sounds like a Britishy good time.</em></p>

<p>As luck would have it, I was already planning on seeing <cite>The Tree of Life</cite> that afternoon with another friend.<sup id="fnref:beginners2"><a href="#fn:beginners2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> I called ahead to see if she&rsquo;d rather meet for <cite>Beginners</cite> instead. That&rsquo;s how I wound up at this movie.</p>

<p>I should point out that &ldquo;that actress from <cite>Cashback</cite>&rdquo; is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0288976/">Emilia Fox</a>, who also happens to not be in this movie. In fact, I had mistaken MÃ©lanie Laurent (of <cite>Inglourious Basterds</cite> fame) for her. Just so we&rsquo;re on the same page, I sat down to the movie expecting a British indie film.</p>

<p>The movie starts out without speaking, with a quiet montage of Oliver (McGregor) cleaning out his father&rsquo;s (Plummer) house after he has passed away. Then he starts speaking, and I realize that he&rsquo;s trying to do an American accent. <em>OK</em>, I think, <em>this must be about Americans</em>. Indeed it is. Even Plummer is playing an American as best he can. (For some reason, old man voice seems to hold up a great deal in the transition across the Atlantic, but still has a bit of uncanniness, <em>cf.</em> Ian McKellen in <cite>The Shadow</cite>.<sup id="fnref:beginners3"><a href="#fn:beginners3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>)</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:beginners1">
      <p>She has spoken roughly like this since she became an Anglophile. (She&rsquo;s specifically enamored with Ireland, but I can&rsquo;t find a word for that, so it&rsquo;s a parenthetical in a footnote instead.)<a href="#fnref:beginners1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:beginners2">
      <p>Next time I&rsquo;ll make up names, I promise.<a href="#fnref:beginners2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:beginners3">
      <p>Or don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s really not a good movie. Tim Curry&rsquo;s American accent is also pretty uncanny in <cite>The Shadow</cite>, and downright bizarre in his performance as Dale the Whale in the Season 2 finale of <cite>Monk</cite>, &ldquo;Mr. Monk Goes to Jail&rdquo;.<a href="#fnref:beginners3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
