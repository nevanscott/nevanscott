				<p>When I wake up, I check my email and a few websites. Sometimes I listen to a podcast or flip through something on my iPad. Sometimes (rarely) I make an effort to read the news. I often hop on Adium pretty soon after I wake up to see if anyone is online to chat with. I spend the majority of most days with my laptop, and it sits next to me as I fall asleep listening to a podcast or audiobook, and then wakes me up with an alarm in the morning. During the day I sometimes entertain myself by watching a TV show or two. I make a lot of phone calls most days to stay in touch with friends and family on the other coast, and even then I often have the computer open in front of me.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is particularly unusual for people my age, or for most ages at this point in time. Even if I didn&#8217;t primarily do my work by making websites, I would probably be on a computer for a good chunk of the day at any other sort of job I could get. And I don&#8217;t even consider myself to be <em>that bad</em> with how much I&#8217;m in front of a computer and connected to the web. I spend hardly any time at all on Facebook, which I always hear about everyone spending gobs of time checking out. Ditto with Twitter. I have a lot of high-minded opinions about why social networking websites are bad or stupid or whatever name I come up with that day, but the truth is probably more like I just get bored easily with them.</p>
<p>I consider myself lucky to say that I generally feel like a productive contributor to the web, and a productive person in general. I&#8217;ve had my hand in a number of websites, none of which have probably changed the world or made it a better place. But there is something to the feeling that I know how to make something on the web, which to me feels like something beyond posting aphorisms to Twitter every so often.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time on the web, and I think for that reason alone, I want it to be a really great place. I personally started interacting with the web through an <span class="caps">AOL</span> account my family got in 1994, when I was 9. I hear about people making interesting contributions to the medium as early as high school or middle school, and at this point I&#8217;m sure that means there are a lot of meaningful contributors to the web who grew up in a world where the web has always existed. I&#8217;m sure a lot of people who interacted with various precursors of the web would say that I&#8217;m already a member of that group. I believe in some ways I&#8217;ve watched the web grow from a subculture into mainstream culture. I wonder if there is any remaining doubt that it is probably here to stay and has simply become a part of humanity in the way that books are the primary record of our history. Books aren&#8217;t a subculture, they are a part of our culture, and the web seems to be as well.</p>
