<h3>John Kricfalusi&#8217;s Review of Meatballs <small><a href="/2009/09/meatballs/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>

<p>For context, John Kricfalusi created <cite>The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</cite>. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2009/09/review-of-meatballs.html">his take</a> on the new movie based on <cite>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a tough time sitting in my seat through Meatballs, because what was happening and who it was happening to was not remotely interesting. It&#8217;s hard to pace a story around characters with no personality.</p>
<p>But as a cartoonist and designer, there was enough visual interest and unique action throughout the movie that intellectually I found things to stimulate me.</p>
<p>It was an optimistic portent of what <em>could</em> be. It&#8217;s basically an undirected film &#8211; but one that allowed many of the artists to take nothing scenes and add some kind of cleverness, design and action to the formulaic events being told by the story.</p>
<p>This in itself is so far ahead of an overdirected film (overdirected by executives typically, not by directors that actually have a point of view or style) that stops creativity from happening every step of the way, just so that more stock plot points, filler and bad puns can happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this kind of thing is enjoyable to read not just because of how harsh it is, but because it touches on something that is really true about the current state of, in my opinion, not just animated films, but most major films. I often find myself settling for the little things in a movie that make it good, rather than expecting something more, maybe in order to seem less like a cynic and an asshole.</p>
<p>But the truth is, there&#8217;s a lot of terrible stuff out there, and the industry that has grown around making movies has moved it from an art form into a calculating box office science. I can only remain optimistic by holding onto my belief that the creative juices going into films have stagnated due to lack of competition. Lower production and distribution costs, one hopes, will eat away at the joint monopoly whose long project has been the reduction of creative work to &#8220;content.&#8221;</p>
<p>Time will tell. Quality endures, but only if it can first find life.</p>

<h3>The Guts of a New Machine <small><a href="/2009/09/guts/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>

<p>Came across this again while digging through the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">DF</a> archives. Rob Walker <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/magazine/30IPOD.html?pagewanted=all">profiles the then-two-year-old iPod</a> for the <cite>Times</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A handful of familiar cliches have made the rounds to explain this &#8212; it&#8217;s about ease of use, it&#8217;s about Apple&#8217;s great sense of design. But what does that really mean? &#8220;Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like,&#8221; says Steve Jobs, Apple&#8217;s C.E.O. &#8220;People think it&#8217;s this veneer &#8212; that the designers are handed this box and told, &#8216;Make it look good!&#8217; That&#8217;s not what we think design is. It&#8217;s not just what it looks like and feels like. <em>Design is how it works</em>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>This idea has, I think, taken root since then, and a respect for the relationship between usability, readability, and visual character on the web in particular has really grown. And yet, some companies seem to continue to try to &#8220;copy Apple&#8221; in all the wrong ways, drawing the wrong inferences, and learning the wrong lessons.</p>
<p>Think about what you&#8217;re making, respect the user and the reader, and make informed decisions along the way to the best of your ability. Setting everything minimally against a white background is not the great lesson of Apple&#8217;s success. The takeaway is to place an emphasis on the user in the design process and not to underestimate the value of quality.</p>

<h3>Kernest <small><a href="/2009/08/kernest/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>

<p><a href="http://kernest.com/">Kernest</a> is one of the first good options for using embedded fonts in a website. Unlike projects like <a href="http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon/about">Cuf&oacute;n</a> or <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/">sIFR</a>, Kernest takes advantage of @font-face embedding, which is now supported by Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.</p>
<p>One of the problems with @font-face at the moment is that Safari and Firefox support font formats like OpenType and TrueType, while Internet Explorer only supports Embedded OpenType. The usual workaround is to supply a different format depending on the requesting browser. This is exactly what Kernest takes care of for you.</p>
<p>Not only will it serve the right file type depending on the browser, it will only serve the font files when the request comes from a domain name tied to that particular font. Many of the current selection of fonts are free, but in order to make them available to your domain, you must activate them. Based on my brief use, this is a very simple process, requiring only a user account, and adding new domains is completely effortless.</p>
<p>After activating a font for your domain, you simply link to a stylesheet specific to your domain on their server. It is worth noting that there is no javascript involved, and this is as it should be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying Kernest out for a few days now, and have found the experience very pleasant all around. I don&#8217;t know much about what TypeKit&#8217;s model will be like, whether they will have some fonts available free of charge, or if there will still be a charge for the service. If not, Kernest looks like it could be a great free alternative for projects without a budget for fonts.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, I highly recommend giving it a try. There are already several serviceable fonts on the site. I&#8217;m currently using <a href="http://ascender-corp.kernest.com/fonts/droid-serif">Droid Serif</a> from <a href="http://ascender-corp.kernest.com/fonts">Ascender Corp</a>.</p>
<p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>: I&#8217;ve since switched to <a href="http://andrey-v-panov.kernest.com/font_families/heuristica">Heuristica</a>.</p>
