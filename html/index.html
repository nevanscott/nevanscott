					<h3>A Pause to Take in Surroundings <small><a href="/2009/12/pause/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>
					<p>Well I&#8217;m sitting here at <span class="caps">LAX</span> at a Samsung Mobile Charging Station. So far, I&#8217;ve used my Visa to cover magazines and Sudafed from a Hudson News, which didn&#8217;t carry Coke. So I bought a soft drink with my Visa from Burger King where using a card was advertised as being &#8220;faster than cash&#8221;. I had to work a bit to figure out how to get both ice and Coke out of the fountain.</p>
<p>Brand and commercial pollution are nothing new, but I hold out hope that these things are subsiding. The whole idea of large corporate entities just seems flawed in this world. It has served us well in the way of making goods so convenient that people are available to focus time and energy on more specific things&#8230; But in many ways, commercialism and new technology have paved the way for a less-informed society that is treated to an incessant barrage of advertisements and other entreatises to spend money. That&#8217;s what our current system more or less depends on. Malls and movie theatres and even airports are so full of things that, simply put, overwhelm and confound.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we need a pause.</p>

					<h3>David Pogue on Cleaning Up the Clutter Online <small><a href="/2009/11/readability/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>
					<p>I believe I agree with the sentiment <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/cleaning-up-the-clutter-online/">here</a> regarding ads, especially on pages that are intended for reading.</p>
<p>As for <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a>, I wish that it were an unnecessary tool. It is a much more difficult project to try to educate writers and designers and readers about typographic treatment on the web. It is more work for the standards makers and browser builders to devise, agree on, and implement ways for type to be treated far more intelligently on the web. But it&#8217;s worth it, because even though there are rules and guidelines to making texts more readable, writing will never be one-design-fits-all.</p>
<p>So, David Pogue, I know you&#8217;re listening. Take on this cause! If people are responding to you so well on Twitter, point them in the direction of <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/indefenseofreaders/">something</a> <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/unreadable/">by</a> <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/">Mandy Brown</a>. The best way to tackle the readability of the web isn&#8217;t by trying to automatically reformat it (although it&#8217;s a good stop-gap). No! We need to raise awareness to push the community of people who write for and publish online to take the extra care to make words readable.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help. :)</p>

					<h3>John Kricfalusi&#8217;s Review of Meatballs <small><a href="/2009/09/meatballs/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>
					<p>For context, John Kricfalusi created <cite>The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</cite>. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2009/09/review-of-meatballs.html">his take</a> on the new movie based on <cite>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a tough time sitting in my seat through Meatballs, because what was happening and who it was happening to was not remotely interesting. It&#8217;s hard to pace a story around characters with no personality.</p>
<p>But as a cartoonist and designer, there was enough visual interest and unique action throughout the movie that intellectually I found things to stimulate me.</p>
<p>It was an optimistic portent of what <em>could</em> be. It&#8217;s basically an undirected film &#8211; but one that allowed many of the artists to take nothing scenes and add some kind of cleverness, design and action to the formulaic events being told by the story.</p>
<p>This in itself is so far ahead of an overdirected film (overdirected by executives typically, not by directors that actually have a point of view or style) that stops creativity from happening every step of the way, just so that more stock plot points, filler and bad puns can happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this kind of thing is enjoyable to read not just because of how harsh it is, but because it touches on something that is really true about the current state of, in my opinion, not just animated films, but most major films. I often find myself settling for the little things in a movie that make it good, rather than expecting something more, maybe in order to seem less like a cynic and an asshole.</p>
<p>But the truth is, there&#8217;s a lot of terrible stuff out there, and the industry that has grown around making movies has moved it from an art form into a calculating box office science. I can only remain optimistic by holding onto my belief that the creative juices going into films have stagnated due to lack of competition. Lower production and distribution costs, one hopes, will eat away at the joint monopoly whose long project has been the reduction of creative work to &#8220;content.&#8221;</p>
<p>Time will tell. Quality endures, but only if it can first find life.</p>

					<h3>The Guts of a New Machine <small><a href="/2009/09/guts/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>
					<p>Came across this again while digging through the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">DF</a> archives. Rob Walker <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/magazine/30IPOD.html?pagewanted=all">profiles the then-two-year-old iPod</a> for the <cite>Times</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A handful of familiar cliches have made the rounds to explain this &#8212; it&#8217;s about ease of use, it&#8217;s about Apple&#8217;s great sense of design. But what does that really mean? &#8220;Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like,&#8221; says Steve Jobs, Apple&#8217;s C.E.O. &#8220;People think it&#8217;s this veneer &#8212; that the designers are handed this box and told, &#8216;Make it look good!&#8217; That&#8217;s not what we think design is. It&#8217;s not just what it looks like and feels like. <em>Design is how it works</em>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>This idea has, I think, taken root since then, and a respect for the relationship between usability, readability, and visual character on the web in particular has really grown. And yet, some companies seem to continue to try to &#8220;copy Apple&#8221; in all the wrong ways, drawing the wrong inferences, and learning the wrong lessons.</p>
<p>Think about what you&#8217;re making, respect the user and the reader, and make informed decisions along the way to the best of your ability. Setting everything minimally against a white background is not the great lesson of Apple&#8217;s success. The takeaway is to place an emphasis on the user in the design process and not to underestimate the value of quality.</p>

					<h3>Kernest <small><a href="/2009/08/kernest/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>
					<p><a href="http://kernest.com/">Kernest</a> is one of the first good options for using embedded fonts in a website. Unlike projects like <a href="http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon/about">Cuf&oacute;n</a> or <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/">sIFR</a>, Kernest takes advantage of @font-face embedding, which is now supported by Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.</p>
<p>One of the problems with @font-face at the moment is that Safari and Firefox support font formats like OpenType and TrueType, while Internet Explorer only supports Embedded OpenType. The usual workaround is to supply a different format depending on the requesting browser. This is exactly what Kernest takes care of for you.</p>
<p>Not only will it serve the right file type depending on the browser, it will only serve the font files when the request comes from a domain name tied to that particular font. Many of the current selection of fonts are free, but in order to make them available to your domain, you must activate them. Based on my brief use, this is a very simple process, requiring only a user account, and adding new domains is completely effortless.</p>
<p>After activating a font for your domain, you simply link to a stylesheet specific to your domain on their server. It is worth noting that there is no javascript involved, and this is as it should be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying Kernest out for a few days now, and have found the experience very pleasant all around. I don&#8217;t know much about what TypeKit&#8217;s model will be like, whether they will have some fonts available free of charge, or if there will still be a charge for the service. If not, Kernest looks like it could be a great free alternative for projects without a budget for fonts.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, I highly recommend giving it a try. There are already several serviceable fonts on the site. I&#8217;m currently using <a href="http://ascender-corp.kernest.com/fonts/droid-serif">Droid Serif</a> from <a href="http://ascender-corp.kernest.com/fonts">Ascender Corp</a>.</p>
<p><span class="update">Update:</span> I&#8217;ve since switched to <a href="http://andrey-v-panov.kernest.com/font_families/heuristica">Heuristica</a>.</p>
<p><span class="update">Update 10 Dec 09:</span> In case it isn&#8217;t obvious, I&#8217;m using neither Droid Serif nor Heuristica anymore.</p>

					<h3>Making Complicated Machines <small><a href="/2007/12/making-complicated-machines/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>
					<p>Computers offer a fascinating window into the play between the simple and the complex. The alphabet of computer language is as simple as they come, with two figures: 1 and 0, known as bits, which typically correspond to high and low voltage electronic pulses. From such a simple base, however, complex functionality can be achieved. On the other hand, seemingly simple behavior can require a substantially complex arrangement of ones and zeros. It also requires well-designed complex machinery to sculpt the flow of bits into something useful.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Computer-Organization-Design-Revised-Printing/dp/0123706068/"><cite>Computer Organization and Design</cite></a>, David Patterson and John Hennessy describe in detail the design of a particular type of machine and its instruction set called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture"><span class="caps">MIPS</span></a> (originally for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages). <span class="caps">MIPS</span> is one way to create the balance needed to make a good computer. The questions at hand in designing such a system include: what functionality need be built directly into the machine itself? how will instructions be represented? how will data be represented? how will the reduced set of operations be sufficient to accomplish a wide variety of more complicated operations? how will these operations be carried out quickly and efficiently?</p>
<p>The authors outline four design principles that guided the solutions to these problems in <span class="caps">MIPS</span>. The first of these, &#8220;simplicity favors regularity,&#8221; indicates that a reliably consistent design affords simpler solutions. For example, <span class="caps">MIPS</span>-32 uses a consistent &#8216;word size&#8217; of 32 bits, meaning instructions and pieces of data are represented by a string of 32 ones and zeros. Having a regular word size allows for some simplicity in the hardware, for example: 32 wires, one for each bit, can be used to communicate both instructions and data &#8211; in fact, the same group of 32 wires can be used for either purpose and for any instruction or piece of data. The second principle is &#8220;smaller is faster.&#8221; Whatever the medium, the representation of bits has to travel through the computer. Shorter travel distances allow for faster computation, plain and simple. The third principle, &#8220;make the common case fast,&#8221; sometimes requires compromise. &#8220;Smaller is faster&#8221; asks for a small set of instructions and corresponding hardware, &#8220;make the common case fast&#8221; asks for instructions and hardware for as many frequently-used operations as possible. Hardware built to parse and quickly compute a larger instruction set take up more space, which can in turn slow down the overall function of the computer. These two principles must be balanced for maximum computing power and speed, which leads to the fourth guiding principle: &#8220;good design demands good compromises.&#8221;</p>
<p>These four principles all inform the design of <span class="caps">MIPS</span>. Thirty-two memory registers are kept close to the processor for temporary storage of 32-bit words currently in play. Access to these words is fast because of their proximity. Likewise, only six bits are required to indicate each, leaving room in 32-bit instructions for a wider variety of common instructions involving values in registers. The size of the architecture is kept small by reusing parts with basic functionality for multiple tasks. Compromises are made to reduce size while accommodating common cases: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are built into the instruction set and the hardware. To take a square root, the operation must be broken down into more basic parts.</p>
<hr />
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Soul-New-Machine-Tracy-Kidder/dp/0316491977/"><cite>The Soul of a New Machine</cite></a>, Tracy Kidder follows Data General, a successful computer company, through the late 1970s as a team within the company worked feverishly to build a state-of-the-art microcomputer. This new computer, the Eagle, needed an architecture built from scratch with lofty restrictions and goals in mind. At the time, Data General&#8217;s bread and butter was a 16-bit microcomputer called the Eclipse. The Eagle would be a 32-bit machine roughly based on the Eclipse. It also set out to be backwards-compatible with the Eclipse: software written for the Eclipse needed to work on the Eagle.</p>
<p>There were also realities in place which added further restrictions to the design of the Eagle. Development of the Eagle was set on a very short timeline: one year. Why? The team working on the Eagle in Massachusetts was subject to competition with another Data General group in North Carolina, also working on a new 32-bit flagship microcomputer. The North Carolina group had a head start and was favored by the company. In fact, the Eagle team operated low key within the company, and included mostly junior engineers fresh out of school. Data General, meanwhile, was playing catchup with rival <span class="caps">DEC</span>, which had already brought a 32-bit machine, the <span class="caps">VAX</span>, to market.</p>
<p>The need for backwards-compatibility with a 16-bit instruction set, combined with the limitations on time and resources added to the compromises required to design and build the Eagle, and get it out the door.</p>
<p>The size of the instruction set was already a compromise. Doubling the word size would cause an increase in the size of the parts of the computer, working against the &#8220;smaller is faster&#8221; principle. The increased word size also vastly increased the number of instructions and data that could be represented with a single word, accommodating more common cases. Sixteen bits offer a vocabulary of about 66,000 words. Thirty-two bits represent 4 billion. In this case, the overwhelming vocabulary gain of the increased word size outweighed the speed hit of the size increase. The jump from 16 to 32 bits also offered another gain. According to Kidder, Eagle&#8217;s architect Steve Wallach reasoned that the increase led to &#8220;the enlargement of the Eclipse&#8217;s logical-address space from 65,000 to 4.3 billion storage compartments.&#8221; The number of spaces in memory that could be addressed increased 65,000-fold.</p>
<p>In building the Eagle, the second principle, &#8220;smaller is faster,&#8221; carried less weight. The goal was to fit the Eagle&#8217;s processor onto seven boards, where other companies were making machines using a single board. According to Kidder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A multiple-board <span class="caps">CPU</span> performs simultaneously many operations that a single-chip <span class="caps">CPU</span> can do only sequentially&#8230; A time was probably coming when components would operate so quickly that the distance that signals had to travel would intimately affect the speed of most commercial computers. Then miniaturization and speed would become more nearly synonymous. But that day had not yet arrived.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compromises between what operations the hardware and software would handle also took place. However, decisions about how to make these compromises were not always geared toward making the Eagle a fast and efficient computer, and more toward ensuring the Eagle would actually <em>be</em> a computer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One Hardy Boy [working on the hardware], Josh Rosen, looks around and can hardly believe what he sees. For example, Microkids [working on the low-level software] and Hardy Boys are arguing. A Microkid wants the hardware to perform a certain function. A Hardy Boy tells him, &#8220;No way — I already did my design for microcode to do that.&#8221; They make a deal: &#8220;I&#8217;ll encode this for you, if you&#8217;ll do this other function in hardware.&#8221; &#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a way to design a computer! &#8220;There&#8217;s no grand design,&#8221; thinks Rosen. &#8220;People are just reaching out in the dark, touching hands.&#8221; Rosen is having some problems with his own piece of the design. He knows he can solve them, if he&#8217;s just given the time. But the managers keep saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s no time.&#8221; Okay. Sure. It&#8217;s a rush job. But this is ridiculous. No one seems to be in control; nothing&#8217;s ever explained. Foul up, however, and the managers come at you from all sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This way of working was even encouraged by the project&#8217;s manager, Tom West, who kept the following written on his white board: &#8220;Not Everything Worth Doing Is Worth Doing Well.&#8221; The limited time and resources available to the project compromised the overall quality of the design of the Eagle itself. There was, however, another human factor contributing to the inability to produce an &#8216;ideal&#8217; design. West, a talented engineer himself, feeling the pressures of looming deadlines, decided at one point to try to examine flaws in the design to debug problems himself. After a few weekends of looking at the prototypes, West decided, &#8220;We&#8217;re way beyond what any one person can do. It&#8217;s too complex.&#8221; The complexity of the design and workings of the Eagle had become great enough that a complete understanding of all the details, decisions, and compromises involved in its engineering was unattainable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Design, like engineering, is about problem solving. When setting out to design a computer architecture, several problems are at play. Machines need to be fast and small. They also need to be reliable and easy to fix or debug. Preferably, they adhere to some standards to ease programming by offering a consistent base for development. In the case of the <span class="caps">MIPS</span> architecture, one of the major design goals was simplicity. The design of the <span class="caps">MIPS</span> architecture, led by John Hennessy, began in 1981 at Stanford University, where the demands of the business world did not impose unreasonable restrictions on time and resources. Aspects of the design could therefore be thought out more carefully than the business-world could afford, lending the design a more complete overall grace and understandability. Data General&#8217;s Eagle team, however, had to sacrifice this idealism in favor of making a machine that worked and would be marketable. This was born out in West&#8217;s policy, &#8220;If you can do a quick-and-dirty job and it works, do it.&#8221; The <span class="caps">MIPS</span> architecture balanced simplicity and complexity in a wholly different way than the Eagle. The difference lay in the problems that needed solving.</p>

					<h3>Some Thoughts on Choice and Reason <small><a href="/2007/06/choice-and-reason/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>
					<p>Last week I read Michael Bierut&#8217;s <a href="http://www.designobserver.com/archives/002559.html">On (Design) Bullshit</a> in Design Observer from a couple of years ago. He talks about the need to give reasons for design choices in order to sell your work to clients:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before I could commit to a design decision, I needed to have an intellectual rationale worked out in my mind. I discovered in short order that most clients seemed grateful for the rationale as well. It put aside arguments about taste; it helped them make the leap of faith that any design decision requires; it made the design understandable to wider audiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my far more limited experience working with design, this is true and apt. Even when &#8216;the client&#8217; is yourself, rationalizing decisions makes you feel better about your own work in the ways that Beirut describes. Beirut himself admits that these rationales amount to bullshit, and at the end of his essay leaves off with an amusing anecdote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember working years ago with a challenging client who kept rejecting brochure designs for a Francophile real estate development because they &#8220;weren&#8217;t French enough.&#8221; I had no idea what French graphic design was supposed to look like but came up with an approach using Empire, a typeface designed by Milwaukee-born Morris Fuller Benton in 1937, and showed it to my boss, Massimo Vignelli. &#8220;That will work,&#8221; he said, his eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>At the presentation, Massimo unveiled the new font choice with a flourish. &#8220;As you see,&#8221; he said, &#8220;in this new design, we&rsquo;re using a typeface called <em>Ahm-peere</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was about to correct him when I realized he was using the French pronunciation of Empire.</p>
<p>The client bought it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, it is clear that the reasons for choosing Empire did not include the fact that it is French, because it is not. However, this was the rationale given to the client, who had some predisposition to thinking that the design somehow needed to be <em>French</em>. The client had a desire that needed fulfilling, and the designers did so with bullshit. This bullshit rationale, however, made the choice of font perfect in the eyes of the client.</p>
<p>It may be hard to see this as a &#8216;bad&#8217; thing overall, because Beirut ostensibly did not choose the font under those same false pretenses. However, this same process &#8211; desire or need followed by false fulfillment &#8211; can take place internally. In other words, when we are already looking for a particular reason to like a choice we have to make, we can easily be too quick to provide ourselves with a satisfactory bullshit reason why a certain choice fits what we need or want to accomplish.</p>
<p>In this way, having reasons that we are predisposed to sets us up to make some choices by default, without considering other options. The important question, when reviewing your own work or someone else&rsquo;s, is not always &#8220;Why did you make this choice?&#8221; Sometimes it is &#8220;What choice did you make here?&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>Michael Beirut <a href="http://www.designobserver.com/archives/025413.html">recently announced</a> the publication of his first book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568986998/designobserver-20/"><cite>Seventy-nine Short Essays on Design</cite></a>.</p>
