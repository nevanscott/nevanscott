<h3>A Report from the Future <small><a href="/2009/12/future/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>

<p>Well I&#8217;m sitting here at <span class="caps">LAX</span> at a Samsung Mobile Charging Station, so I thought it was as good a time as any to start reflecting on the decade up until this point.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> So far, I&#8217;ve used my Visa to cover magazines and Sudafed from a Hudson News, which didn&#8217;t carry Coke, so I bought a soft drink with my Visa from Burger King where using a card was advertised as being &#8220;faster than cash&#8221; and I had to work a bit to figure out how to get both ice and Coke out of the machine that we are told is a fountain but bears little resemblance to my eyes.</p>
<p>Brand and commercial pollution are nothing new, but I hold out hope that these things are subsiding. The whole idea of large corporate entities just seems flawed in this world. It has served us well in the way of making goods so convenient that people are open to focusing time and energy on more specific things. TK But in many ways, commercialism and new technology have paved the way for a less-informed society that is treated to an incessant barrage of advertisements and other entreatises to spend money. That&#8217;s what our current system more or less depends on. This is one of the reasons it is harder for me to venture out in the world. Malls and movie theatres and even airports are so full of things that, simply put, overwhelm and confound, that it&#8217;s just not worth going on a regular basis.</p>
<hr class="footnote" />
<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> If you&#8217;re like me, you probably aren&#8217;t sure whether to consider the upcoming New Year the start of a New Decade. For all the hooha that circulated around the turn of the millenium, including the arguments over whether the start should be considered January 1st, 2000 or 2001 &#8211; I decided to celebrate both anyway &#8211; it turned out that for all intents and purposes this decade didn&#8217;t start until late 2001 anyway. And this is how it has always been. From what I can remember, the 80s lingered well into the early 90s, at least if we are to believe the record Hollywood and <span class="caps">MTV</span> have left us.</p>

<h3>Moving Web Type Forward <small><a href="/2009/11/moving-web-type-forward/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>

<p>In recent years, a lot has been done to improve the state of typography on the web, and it shows. It is actually possible to read online on a regular basis, or print newspapers wouldn&#8217;t be struggling as much as they are to transition into a new economic system.</p>
<p>Luckily, for those of us who are energized by the renaissance of the visual word, there is still much to be done. To add to the excitement, many of the things needed to move things forward are probably going to take joint effort from a variety of specialties. So, let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h4>Hyphenation</h4>
<p>When type was set in medal, the process of hyphenation and justification was literally in the hands of the typesetter. On the web, the typesetter is the browser, which renders type guided by <span class="caps">CSS</span> rules. The browser knows where text is broken onto new lines when the producer of the site does not, partially because the browser knows about the device that it is rendering text on. Fonts may be substituted, sizes may be altered, the width of the view may be narrower or wider. This is as it should be: the browser should handle typesetting.</p>
<p>At the moment, the following <span class="caps">CSS</span> rule will ask the typesetter to justify paragraph text:</p>
<pre><code>
p { text-align: justify; }
</code></pre>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a trivial problem to solve,</p>
<hr />
<p>This is some information about the kind of stuff we need going forward.</p>
<p>As a quick aside before getting into this list, I should point out that I think for the most part the issue of web fonts is a bit of a distraction from a lot of other problems that are less sexy because they&#8217;re (intentionally) less visible to most users.</p>
<p>Here are the real things that would be helpful immediately:</p>
<hr />
<p>We need a good dictionary system to work in conjunction with web browsers to feed them hyphenation information for different languages and implementation across the board of a standard <span class="caps">CSS</span> rule for giving the browser instructions for how to hyphenate. This also needs to be really fast.</p>
<hr />
<p>We need simple <span class="caps">CSS</span> rules for giving instructions about widows and their handling. We also need to be better able to give an indication regarding orphaned lines in print media. Both of these should be handled in a reasonable way by the defaults for the browser.</p>
<p>Automatic detection of ligatures and <span class="caps">CSS</span> rules for <span class="caps">OTF</span> features such as lining, text, and tabular figures; stylistic alternates; discretionary ligatures; true small caps; etc.</p>
<p>There should be a way to specify whether text is vertically centered within the line-height as it is now, or instead attached to the baseline as expected by most print designers. For now, the default should be left. This is less critical than the above.</p>
<p>Along with the things mentioned, we also really need at least one solid typeface to work with. That&#8217;s what is so encouraging about the work currently being done to refresh the ubiquitous Georgia typeface. I can only hope that the family will be free to download and easy to install, or possibly that it might be bundled with the browsers in some kind of update or something. Without a free typeface installed on a vast majority of machines, in order to take advantage of open-type features we would need a consistent and stable way to embed such a font (even for a fee) into websites.</p>
<p>Either way we need at least one rock-solid typeface with support for internationalization and al of the open-type features in order to avoid a separation between websites that can afford a budget for fonts and those that cannot.</p>

<h3>Abstracting Away the File System <small><a href="/2009/11/filesystem-abstraction/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>

<p>When I was in school, my computer science professor was fond of saying, &#8220;Bits is bits.&#8221; What he meant is that all of computer science is an abstraction.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> When thinking about computers, it is important to keep the principle of abstraction in mind. Without going into too much detail, computers are essentially made up of ones and zeros. The idea of the filesystem, the one that most users interact with through a graphical operating system, is a metaphor or abstraction that the operating system provides to the user and to the applications that the user interacts with.</p>
<p>As we approach another decade in computing, it might be worth asking why our computers organize information in this way and why it is presented in such a fashion to the user. I know people, myself included, who still use pieces of paper that can be filed away in a real folder or sometimes stored more permanently in a file cabinet. But modern use of those organizational tools is significantly lower than it was two decades ago. Some people my age are entering the workforce having spent more time interacting with their computer&#8217;s file system than they have spent looking at sheets of paper, much less using them or storing them away.</p>
<p>So why continue to think about the data storage using the same filesystem metaphor, especially in cases where another metaphor may make more sense? TK I believe this is one of the reasons for the early success of iTunes. When Napster popularized music downloading and made MP3 a household word, one of the biggest problems was trying to make these files fit into a storage metaphor based on organizing business documents. Everyone was coming up with their own systems for keeping these files organized. Some would create folders for every artist and every album; others might split up files by genre first, then by artist; some (like me) tended to keep everything in a flat structure and rely on filename conventions like <code>Cream_White_Room.mp3</code> to find a track. This was a mess, and clearly a broken system because you could only organize tracks in one way. If you wanted to keep your music organized by album, you couldn&#8217;t also organize tracks into playlists unless you made copies of the songs.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> And then what if you wanted to have a single track in more then one playlist? In 1999, I thought The Beatles went with everything&#8212;what if I wanted <cite>Nowhere Man</cite> in playlists for &#8220;Happy&#8221;, &#8220;Sad&#8221;, and &#8220;Fun&#8221;?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recall if iTunes had figured out how to address these problems when it was first released, but not long after iTunes had figure out a good way to keep the user from every worrying about where their music files were or how they were organized. The solution on the Mac runs somewhat deep: When Apple was putting together OS X, it clearly already had at least an inkling of its &#8220;digital hub strategy&#8221; in mind, and decided that User folders would include a few folders for media right out of the box, including Music. On OS X, iTunes took advantage of this folder to give users the option to let iTunes keep their music files organized for them.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="http://rosscarter.com/2009/279.html">Ross Carter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;For documents that are recognized by multiple apps, the user has the power to bind a particular document to any app they wish, using the file inspector in Finder. So at least for this purpose the creator code is not needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two words come to mind: <em>puh leez</em>. In what universe do people create a file and immediately, whistling with merriment, go to Finder and change the application binding for that document?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as this argument makes complete sense in a lot of ways, I find myself having the opposite point of view. There is, to my mind, a good potential reason for this kind of change, and I would welcome it if I were yet able to upgrade to Snow Leopard.</p>
<p>This change accompanies another ongoing change, which is the breakdown in the importance of the filesystem itself, which carries important ramifications across the spectrum of computer users.</p>
<p>I have long not understood the refrain that the Mac is not designed for everyone, as if this is somehow the reason that the Mac only has a small percentage of the market share. It may not be priced for everyone, but that is hardly the same as not being designed for everyone. A contemporary Windows PC, by comparison, has price points in everyone&#8217;s range, but is, in my skewed view, not really designed for anyone, except maybe CTOs and gamers.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The contemporary Mac, by comparison, is designed for a wide range of uses; in my opinion, it is a more general platform than Windows. This is easy to forget, because it is so easy to use a Mac in a very specific manner, which is the beauty of its design. This is because ease of use is, as it should be, useful for everyone, no matter what they are doing. Some people use primarily the applications that come with the Mac: especially iTunes and Safari. These are great tools for people who spend most of their time on their computer either browsing the web or consuming music, movies, and TV shows.</p>
<p>But the Mac has also emerged as a great development platform, not least because of its Unix core. The Mac has a wealth of great text editors available to it, such as BBEdit, TextWrangler, and TextMate, but you can also run editors like vim and emacs. Transmit and Cyberduck are both great and intuitive <span class="caps">FTP</span> clients. Expandrive is a great way to use the Finder to interact with remote servers over various protocols. Coda and Espresso are promising web development environments. I can easily run a <span class="caps">LAMP</span>, Django, or Ruby on Rails application natively on my Mac for development, and easily translate that work onto a Linux server.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The Mac is undoubtedly a great platform for anyone working with images, video, and sound. In addition to the stable of Adobe software geared toward these users, there are Apple&#8217;s own entries in these fields, some of which are basically industry standards like Final Cut.</p>
<hr class="footnote" />
<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> He was also referring to Von Neuman&#8217;s decision to keep instructions and data in the same place.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> OK, to my memory there <em>were</em> solutions to this problem, where an MP3 player could basically create a playlist file for you with data about where the MP3 files in the playlist were stored on the hard drive. Guess how well this worked when you wanted to move files around?</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> footnote here? TK</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn4"><sup>4</sup> I should be very clear here in pointing out that I am certain these things are all possible and probably even easy to do on a Windows machine as well, but I don&#8217;t know because I don&#8217;t develop on a Windows machine. I can vouch for how easy these things are to do on a Mac.</p>

<h3>David Pogue on Cleaning Up the Clutter Online <small><a href="/2009/11/readability/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>

<p>I believe I agree with the sentiment <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/cleaning-up-the-clutter-online/">here</a> regarding ads, especially on pages that are intended for reading.</p>
<p>As for <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/">Readability</a>, I wish that it were an unnecessary tool. It is a much more difficult project to try to educate writers and designers and readers about typographic treatment on the web. It is more work for the standards makers and browser builders to devise, agree on, and implement ways for type to be treated far more intelligently on the web. But it&#8217;s worth it, because even though there are rules and guidelines to making texts more readable, writing will never be one-design-fits-all.</p>
<p>So, David Pogue, I know you&#8217;re listening. Take on this cause! If people are responding to you so well on Twitter, point them in the direction of <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/indefenseofreaders/">something</a> <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/library/archives/unreadable/">by</a> <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/">Mandy Brown</a>. The best way to tackle the readability of the web isn&#8217;t by trying to automatically reformat it (although it&#8217;s a good stop-gap). No! We need to raise awareness to push the community of people who write for and publish online to take the extra care to make words readable.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help. :)</p>

<h3>John Kricfalusi&#8217;s Review of Meatballs <small><a href="/2009/09/meatballs/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>

<p>For context, John Kricfalusi created <cite>The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</cite>. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2009/09/review-of-meatballs.html">his take</a> on the new movie based on <cite>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had a tough time sitting in my seat through Meatballs, because what was happening and who it was happening to was not remotely interesting. It&#8217;s hard to pace a story around characters with no personality.</p>
<p>But as a cartoonist and designer, there was enough visual interest and unique action throughout the movie that intellectually I found things to stimulate me.</p>
<p>It was an optimistic portent of what <em>could</em> be. It&#8217;s basically an undirected film &#8211; but one that allowed many of the artists to take nothing scenes and add some kind of cleverness, design and action to the formulaic events being told by the story.</p>
<p>This in itself is so far ahead of an overdirected film (overdirected by executives typically, not by directors that actually have a point of view or style) that stops creativity from happening every step of the way, just so that more stock plot points, filler and bad puns can happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this kind of thing is enjoyable to read not just because of how harsh it is, but because it touches on something that is really true about the current state of, in my opinion, not just animated films, but most major films. I often find myself settling for the little things in a movie that make it good, rather than expecting something more, maybe in order to seem less like a cynic and an asshole.</p>
<p>But the truth is, there&#8217;s a lot of terrible stuff out there, and the industry that has grown around making movies has moved it from an art form into a calculating box office science. I can only remain optimistic by holding onto my belief that the creative juices going into films have stagnated due to lack of competition. Lower production and distribution costs, one hopes, will eat away at the joint monopoly whose long project has been the reduction of creative work to &#8220;content.&#8221;</p>
<p>Time will tell. Quality endures, but only if it can first find life.</p>

<h3>The Guts of a New Machine <small><a href="/2009/09/guts/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>

<p>Came across this again while digging through the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">DF</a> archives. Rob Walker <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/magazine/30IPOD.html?pagewanted=all">profiles the then-two-year-old iPod</a> for the <cite>Times</cite>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A handful of familiar cliches have made the rounds to explain this &#8212; it&#8217;s about ease of use, it&#8217;s about Apple&#8217;s great sense of design. But what does that really mean? &#8220;Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like,&#8221; says Steve Jobs, Apple&#8217;s C.E.O. &#8220;People think it&#8217;s this veneer &#8212; that the designers are handed this box and told, &#8216;Make it look good!&#8217; That&#8217;s not what we think design is. It&#8217;s not just what it looks like and feels like. <em>Design is how it works</em>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>This idea has, I think, taken root since then, and a respect for the relationship between usability, readability, and visual character on the web in particular has really grown. And yet, some companies seem to continue to try to &#8220;copy Apple&#8221; in all the wrong ways, drawing the wrong inferences, and learning the wrong lessons.</p>
<p>Think about what you&#8217;re making, respect the user and the reader, and make informed decisions along the way to the best of your ability. Setting everything minimally against a white background is not the great lesson of Apple&#8217;s success. The takeaway is to place an emphasis on the user in the design process and not to underestimate the value of quality.</p>

<h3>Kernest <small><a href="/2009/08/kernest/">&#8734;</a></small></h3>

<p><a href="http://kernest.com/">Kernest</a> is one of the first good options for using embedded fonts in a website. Unlike projects like <a href="http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon/about">Cuf&oacute;n</a> or <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/">sIFR</a>, Kernest takes advantage of @font-face embedding, which is now supported by Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.</p>
<p>One of the problems with @font-face at the moment is that Safari and Firefox support font formats like OpenType and TrueType, while Internet Explorer only supports Embedded OpenType. The usual workaround is to supply a different format depending on the requesting browser. This is exactly what Kernest takes care of for you.</p>
<p>Not only will it serve the right file type depending on the browser, it will only serve the font files when the request comes from a domain name tied to that particular font. Many of the current selection of fonts are free, but in order to make them available to your domain, you must activate them. Based on my brief use, this is a very simple process, requiring only a user account, and adding new domains is completely effortless.</p>
<p>After activating a font for your domain, you simply link to a stylesheet specific to your domain on their server. It is worth noting that there is no javascript involved, and this is as it should be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying Kernest out for a few days now, and have found the experience very pleasant all around. I don&#8217;t know much about what TypeKit&#8217;s model will be like, whether they will have some fonts available free of charge, or if there will still be a charge for the service. If not, Kernest looks like it could be a great free alternative for projects without a budget for fonts.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, I highly recommend giving it a try. There are already several serviceable fonts on the site. I&#8217;m currently using <a href="http://ascender-corp.kernest.com/fonts/droid-serif">Droid Serif</a> from <a href="http://ascender-corp.kernest.com/fonts">Ascender Corp</a>.</p>
<p><span class="update">Update:</span> I&#8217;ve since switched to <a href="http://andrey-v-panov.kernest.com/font_families/heuristica">Heuristica</a>.</p>
<p><span class="update">Update 10 Dec 09:</span> In case it isn&#8217;t obvious, I&#8217;m using neither Droid Serif nor Heuristica anymore.</p>
