		<p>I joined <a href="http://www.reasonmediagroup.com/">Reason Media Group</a> as they took on building POM&#8217;s new website with the goal of engaging POM&#8217;s community of fans alongside POM&#8217;s design agency, <a href="http://www.roll.com/fire-station-agency.php">Fire Station</a>. When I joined, the project was already slated to be built on <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> and <a href="http://buddypress.org/">Buddypress</a>; I worked with another developer to build out the new site over three months, taking care of both front-end and back-end development tasks. After the site&#8217;s launch, <acronym title="Reason Media Group"><span class="caps">RMG</span></acronym> was asked to further the design, so I took on a more leading role in front-end development and design.</p>

			<p>POM&#8217;s homepage needed to emphasize all of the activity going on in the community without being overwhelming. I advocated using a more structured design, so that we could accomodate a dense amount of information without looking too busy.</p><p>A prior version of the site had three different areas that were cross-fading &#8211; the feature area, tweets, and testimonials. I wanted to cut down on the calamity, so I built a jQuery plugin that allowed the activity bubbles from the new community activity feed to scroll in from the top.</p>

			<p>When it came time to build a new landing page for the community section of the site, my choice to use a grid for layout paid off because we were able to easily reuse design elements that we had built for the homepage.</p>

			<p>As part of POM&#8217;s strategy for engaging with their customers, they began holding regular contests, and we needed an easy way for members of the <span class="caps">POM</span> team to add new contests to the site that would in turn be easy for members of the site to participate in.</p>

			<p>Early on in the first round of the project, I took some time to build this custom rotation image area using jQuery, to showcase the photography of their recipes. Not much to look at, but this was a big step up from relying on Flash, and I had only been working with jQuery for a few weeks at the time.</p>
