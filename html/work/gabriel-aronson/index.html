		<p>Gabe is a close friend and frequent collaborator, and I have helped him with his web presence for a couple of years now, off and on. For this most recent version, I asked him to let me take on the bulk or the design work for his new portfolio, so that he could focus on what he was working on at the time. After my initial round, he worked on a great background and we hammered out details until we arrived at a good starting place to grow the site from. Really, you should stop reading this and <a href="http://gabrielaronson.com/">go see his stuff</a>.</p>

			<p>There really isn&#8217;t anything innovative here. Mostly, I wanted something that would be dead-simple to navigate and easy for Gabe to update, that would visually stay out of the way so that all of his work could really shine, but have a quirky feel to complement Gabe&#8217;s work.</p>
