			<h3>Pom Wonderful</h3>
			<div class="caption">
				<p>I joined <a href="http://www.reasonmediagroup.com/">Reason Media Group</a> as they took on building Pom&#8217;s new website with the goal of engaging Pom&#8217;s community of fans alongside Pom&#8217;s design agency, <a href="http://www.roll.com/fire-station-agency.php">Fire Station</a>. When I joined, the project was already slated to be built on <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> and <a href="http://buddypress.org/">Buddypress</a>; I worked with another developer to build out the new site over three months, taking care of both front-end and back-end development tasks. After the site&#8217;s launch, <acronym title="Reason Media Group"><span class="caps">RMG</span></acronym> was asked to further the design, so I took on a more leading role in front-end development and design.</p>

			<h3>Gabriel Aronson</h3>
			<div class="caption">
				<p>Gabe is a close friend and frequent collaborator, and I have helped him with his web presence for a couple of years now, off and on. For this most recent round, I asked him to let me take on the bulk of the design work for his new portfolio, so that he could focus on what he was working on at the time. After my initial draft, he worked on a great background and we hammered out details until we arrived at a good starting place to grow the site from. Really, you should stop reading this and <a href="http://gabrielaronson.com/">go see his stuff</a>.</p>

			<h3>The Roar</h3>
			<div class="caption">
				<p>At <a href="http://www.reasonmediagroup.com/">Reason Media Group</a>, we started dialogue with the <a href="http://www.milkenschool.org/">Milken Community High School</a> in Los Angeles about building and designing a site for the school&#8217;s student-run newspaper. I got to take the design lead for this early prototype, which showcases some of our thinking about what a modern high school online publication might be like.</p>
