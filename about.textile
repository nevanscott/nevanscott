I live and work in New York City, but I have close friends and family in San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, and Dublin. The thing to know about me is that I really like people. Nothing gets me out of bed in the morning like the thought of collaborating closely with people whom I respect, and nothing keeps me going on nights and weekends like the great conversations I have with friends whom I love.

I have many interests, which is only notable in a section called "About Me" because it is so much of who I am. I have always prided myself on being able to talk to people about the things that interest them and that they care about. I sometimes take ideas a little too seriously, but that's just a result of my innate belief that there is something fundamentally captivating about being a human among humans. Every individual has so much inside - in a way, there is no way to avoid this while going through the act of living. The way some people put this is that we all have a story. I tend to think that we all _are_ a story.

This site holds some of my writing and projects I've been working on. There's "a feed for my writing":/writing.xml, if you like.
