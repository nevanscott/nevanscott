h3. About Me

Hi, I'm Nevan Scott, just like it says up top. I recently started a new job at "Arc 90":http://arc90.com/. (This is a big change. So far my third day is a Snow Day - why didn't I get a Fire Day in L.A.? - and one of my co-workers prodded me to update my about page "via Twitter":https://twitter.com/closacco/status/8911811265.) For now, I'm staying with a friend in Harlem and looking for a new place to call home.

h3. About the Site

This is where I sometimes try to write and show some of the projects I've been working on.

If you are using a modern browser on a desktop machine, you are probably reading this in Font Font's Meta Serif Web Pro and Meta Web Pro, delivered to you by "Typekit":http://typekit.com/, a service which I am still relatively new to, but is worth looking into if you like typography sorts of things and haven't already. (You might also get some good mileage out of "Kernest":http://kernest.com/ or "Font Squirrel":http://fontsquirrel.com/ if you prefer to serve your own fonts.) If you are on a device that Typekit doesn't support, you're in for a real treat: Matthew Carter's beautiful Georgia, designed specifically for the screen in the 90s and still awesome.

Thanks also to "Tom Preston-Werner":http://tom.preston-werner.com/ and others for their work on "Jekyll":http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll, which I use to generate the site from some intuitive source files.

For the purposes of laying out the site quickly, I'm relying on a grid stylesheet provided by "Blueprint":http://www.blueprintcss.org/, generated "here":http://bgg.kematzy.com/.
